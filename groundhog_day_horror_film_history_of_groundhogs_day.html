“Happy Death Day,” a horror riff on the “Groundhog Day” model, opens with the Universal logo stopping and restarting, just as the company name is circling the globe. It’s a clever riff on the fact that audiences know what they’re coming to see—a film in which the same events repeat over and over again. 
Small things like lighting, music, camera angles, the look on an actor's face etc can make a massive difference as to whether a movie comes across as a horror or a comedy. Given that Groundhog Day was made by some of the finest comic veterans in the industry, I think it's a fair bet to say that it was never meant to be a horror movie. 
Groundhog Day Was a Horror Movie All Along The 1993 existential comedy has become a meme and a metaphor for this moment. But that’s only partly because of its exploration of monotony. 
Happy Death Day is a 2017 American black comedy slasher film directed by Christopher Landon and written by Scott Lobdell.It stars Jessica Rothe and Israel Broussard.. The film follows college student Tree Gelbman, who is murdered on the night of her birthday but begins reliving the day repeatedly, at which point she sets out to find the killer and stop her death. 
This is officially my second favorite Groundhog day type movie. It is such a heart-wrenching movie with a tragic story and a surprisingly amusing bizarreness in its premise. It makes a scary, effective theme and atmosphere out of a seemingly innocent children’s song. 
Groundhog Day (1993) is the perfect film The core of the film is character development, Bill Murray is so deep in character, there feels like there are some borderline method moments. His comedic timing &amp; acting is unique, subtle &amp; fantastic.
