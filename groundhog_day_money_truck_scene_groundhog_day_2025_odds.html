Can groundhog drives a truck? Funny little groundhog a rodent with Punxsutawney Phil (Bill Murray) moves by the police chase. 
At the party scene at the end of the movie, Phil's piano teacher screams "That's my student!", when Phil plays the piano. This shouldn't be the case as the teacher was paid with a bag of cash Phil stole from the back of the money truck, and the day that let Phil out of the time loop was the day where he only committed virtuous acts. 
Harold Ramis’s 1993 “Groundhog Day,” starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell, is a beloved comedy classic. In one scene, news anchor Phil Connors (Murray) steals a classic Chevy truck after kidnapping Punxsutawney Phil and full-sends it off a cliff. It’s one of the most iconic scenes from the film. 
Funny and profound, Groundhog Day holds up on repeat viewing, allowing you to catch the jokes and sight gags you might have missed the first time. In honor of another Groundhog Day, I put together a list of the film’s 50 funniest moments, including an amusing bit that’s in one of the deleted scenes that didn’t make the final movie.

The tale of jaded weatherman Phil Connors, who learns to become a better person by reliving the same day, over and over, has a 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and is one of IMDB.com's 250 top-rated

The armored truck drivers don't initially realize there is money missing, but someone would surely notice very quickly, possibly even that day. A search would begin for the thief, I'd imagine that there would be a security camera outside of the bank or at least somewhere along Murray's route while carrying the money that would see him.

Probably one of the best fanedits that I've seen do far and another great work by bobson dugnutt too. Deleted scenes while some may feel like filler and even an add-on like the homeless man's last scene for example which was a touching scene but I could understand why the filmmaker didn't keep it in the original as they already made their point that Bill Murray is still a human and not a god  
When Phil looks out the window on the first Groundhog Day, he sees the right-turning truck outside the window just as the radio people shout “Groundhog Day”, but on the first repeat of the day, the same scene outside the window occurs only after this exclamation is made.
