        <p>107 votes, 40 comments. true. It’s my favorite movie of all time. It really explores character development in an interesting way, where the protagonist changes but the world stays the same. 
Groundhog Day is so amazing in part because it’s a movie that could very easily have been a terrible movie. The gimmick was treated perfectly and struck the perfect balance of drama and comedy. In the hands of other directors/actors this would have likely gone the way of some cheesy forgotten 90s comedy 
30yrs old now and this movie is amazing. It’s definitely jumped way up the list in my head of all time faves. Unbelievable cast, excellent script, perfect pacing, and just fun. Poignant moments, funny momentsI mean Bull Murray was the perfect lead for this. And such a satisfying character arc. There is nothing unnecessary in this movie either.

I think "Groundhog Day" is the best movie ever made. The story of a cursed man gaining redemption is my favorite. The 1993 film starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell is like classic literature.

"Groundhog Day" (citywide) may not be the funniest collaboration between Bill Murray and director Harold Ramis, and it doesn't have a chance of being the most financially successful.

Groundhog Day is easily my favorite movie, and my other favorite movies have a very similar feel. Hook with Robin Williams, and Yes Man with Jim Carrey are really good. It also helps when a funny person is the lead like Bill Murray. 
I think you kinda missed the point of the movie. Phil is a horrible, immoral person. He is destined to repeat the day over and over (according to the late comedy genius Harold Ramis "for 30 or 40 years") until he realizes his flaws, corrects them, and becomes a capital-G Good Person.

The Tom Cruise movie Edge of Tomorrow (aka Live/Die/Repeat) borrows ideas from both Replay and Groundhog Day: Looped time period over and over Selfish protagonist that has to become selfless and serve others Emily Blunt’s character is named Rita just like Andie MacDowell’s character in Groundhog Day 
Groundhog Day has always been one of my favorite comedies. It has a great premise and some of the best character actors in a single film. "Ned, Ned Ryerson"! The movie is such a great comedy I'm always caught off guard by the scenes where the old man dies. It is such a heart tugging collection of moments that never fails to bring a tear to my eye.

I'm highly interested in movies with plot revolving around traveling back in time while retaining all your memories. Perfect example is movie Groundhog Day, repeating some time segment until you get the things right.

I love Groundhog Day (1993) and I've seen it over a hundred times since it came out. However, I still can't get over finding out that Fred, the young groom -to-be to whom Phil bestows Wrestlemania tickets was played by a 21 yo, then unknown but now legendary actor, Michael Shannon, who would later play General Zod, Elvis, the Iceman, and many more. 
Only in terms of the stuck-in-time thing. Please don't give away any big plotlines or any spoilers but I love that sort of plot (like with the trickster/angel in s3 I think, if you watch Supernatural) of stuck in time. </p>
