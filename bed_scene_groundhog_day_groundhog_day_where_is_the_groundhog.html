        <p>"I swear I would love you""Did you say something?"A film by Harold Ramis(c) Columbia Pictures 
For this episode Dave and Rob along with a guest host, will be discussing the favorite holiday film Groundhog Day, starring Bill Murray. The hosts will take  
As all of us at Withings care deeply about sleep, here is a compilation of 10 great movie scenes evolving around waking up. Enjoy! And if you want to know more about our activity and sleep trackers or our advanced sleep tracking mat, those links will tell you all you need to know. 1. Groundhog Day: “Get up and check that hog” 
Groundhog Day (1993) 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
In honor of another Groundhog Day, I put together a list of the film’s 50 funniest moments, including an amusing bit that’s in one of the deleted scenes that didn’t make the final movie.

Phil learns the fragility (and preciousness) of life through his repeated and futile attempts to save a dying, homeless old man whom he was mean to in the first years of his stay on Groundhog Day. This is especially heartbreaking because the old man looks EXTREMELY happy and grateful from the very first moment Phil meets him in the evening. 
Groundhog Day: Directed by Harold Ramis. With Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliott, Stephen Tobolowsky. A narcissistic, self-centered weatherman finds himself in a time loop on Groundhog Day.
