        <p>The Groundhog Day inspirations are obvious in this movie, but it feels fresh with how the time loop mechanic is used as a source of dark humor, cathartic change, and character development. Both Samberg and Milioti bring tons of fun and chemistry to their roles, making Palm Springs one of the most enjoyable in the genre. 
Today Detective Brett Hopper will be accused of shooting state attorney Alberto Garza. He will offer his rock solid alibi. He will realize he's been framed. And he will run. Then he will wake up and start the day over again. Detective Charlie Crews was framed, convicted and cleared for a crime he  
This film mirrors the repeated attempts of Phil Connors to win over Rita in Groundhog Day, blending humor with the protagonist's quest for the perfect outcome. Premise: After spending a night with the girl of his dreams only to become just friends, a man gets the opportunity to travel through time and alter that night over and over again until  
While there have been plenty of time loop movies over the years, many have used the concept to dramatic effect, like in 12 Monkeys and Source Code.However, the classic 1990s comedy Groundhog Day helped popularize the time loop comedy subgenre in which a character is stuck reliving the same day over and over again until they figure out how to break the loop, leading to all kinds of hijinks as  
Blood Punch — Feature Film (2014): Another film in the Groundhog Day genre. Described on IMDb as a “Horror/Thriller” but it was more of a very dark comedy rom-com! The Endless — Feature Film (2017): It only just squeaks in as a Groundhog Day type film. Not because there isn’t a time loop; more likely because there isn’t just the one. 
A person reliving the same day over and over again-- with such a spectacularly simple yet wildly brilliant idea, Groundhog Day became a cultural phenomenon. Infamously, Danny Rubin, the  
You can stream some of these movies like Groundhog Day on Netflix, Amazon Prime or Hulu. 12. 12 Dates of Christmas (2011) Probably the most low key movie on the list, ’12 Dates of Christma’ refers to the timeline for Kate, a young, ambitious woman, who perseveres to maintain healthy relationships in her life. 
Happy Death Day was a surpise box office smash, grossing $117 million on a $4.8 million budget. The film—which centers around a narcissistic college girl—even includes a cheeky reference to  
Run Lola Run. Far from mimicking Groundhog Day specifically, this breakthrough German film for director Tom Tykwer and actress Franke Potente has other cinematic cousins, more so those following

Groundhog Day is a 1993 fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin, and starring Bill Murray.Known for massively popularizing the time loop trope (to the extent that it's referred to on this site as the "Groundhog Day" Loop), cementing its namesake day into the modern lexicon as a stand-in for an unpleasant, repetitive situation, and serving as a  
Office worker Barry Thomas is forced to relive the worst day of his life. [11] Groundhog Day: 1993: Self-centered television weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is forced to relive the same day over and over. [12] This movie is generally seen as the quintessential time-loop movie by many with its name being synonymous with the genre as a whole. 
I really enjoyed re-watching Groundhog Day a couple of days ago, has anybody got a recommendation of a similar type of movie? Not necessarily another rom-com or comedy, but any movie with a kind of surreal and well executed concept like that one. 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
But the film cleverly turns Murray’s sarcastic outsider persona against him and the film evolves into a sweet fable about humanity. Murray plays Phil Connors, an egotistical Pittsburgh weatherman who hates nothing more than Groundhog Day. He detests covering the annual festival in nearby Punxsutawney, PA, and he especially despises shar 
Murray had creative differences with the director. First and foremost, Murray had the idea that Groundhog Day should be more of a thinker piece—the type of movie that makes you question life and  
Interestingly, the film is an adaptation of Richard Lupoff’s short story 12.01pm, which was itself then adapted for the 1990 TV movie 12.01pm. Perhaps, then, Groundhog Day actually ripped off 12

Groundhog Day (1993) is the perfect film The core of the film is character development, Bill Murray is so deep in character, there feels like there are some borderline method moments. His comedic timing &amp; acting is unique, subtle &amp; fantastic. 
Naked (2017) -- Marlon Wayans time loop movie Also, not a movie, but-- Twilight Zone (2020) Ep. "Try, Try" -- sort of a reverse time loop main character has ordinary day, but she meets someone who's at the "Bill Murray is a total creep" part of the movie </p>
