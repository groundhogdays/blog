Groundhog Day is a 1993 fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin, and starring Bill Murray.Known for massively popularizing the time loop trope (to the extent that it's referred to on this site as the "Groundhog Day" Loop), cementing its namesake day into the modern lexicon as a stand-in for an unpleasant, repetitive situation, and serving as a
