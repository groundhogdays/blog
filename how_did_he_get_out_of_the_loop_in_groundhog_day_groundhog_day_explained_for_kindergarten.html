        <p>PHIL : As he crosses to the bed, he accidentally knocks over the suitcase stand, spilling his clothes out onto the floor.-25- He contemplates picking them up for a moment, decides to leave them there, and flops down on the bed. He lies there looking up at the ceiling until the room starts to spin around, then he closes his eyes and quickly  
At the end of Groundhog Day, Phil Connors learns to use the time he has to enhance his life and use his abilities to help others, making him a popular figure in Punxsutawney, finally winning the heart of Rita, and breaking the endless repeating loop of Groundhog Day. 
The 1993 Harold Ramis comedy "Groundhog Day" may not have spawned the hero-caught-in-a-time-loop genre, but it certainly prodded it to life.To this day, the film carries a 97% rating from critics  
According to WhatCulture.com — which meticulously took into account the 38 days actually shown during Groundhog Day; the 414 days that were mentioned; the 11,931 days Phil spent learning things like ice sculpting, French poetry, and playing the piano; and the days he spent performing good deeds — Harold's second estimate was much closer. 
Is there a deeper meaning to the time loop in Groundhog Day? The time loop can be interpreted as a metaphor for the repetitive nature of life and the opportunity it presents for personal growth and transformation. 12. Why is Groundhog Day considered a comedy? While Groundhog Day deals with profound themes, it is considered a comedy due to its  
At first, he didn't get it, and kept to his old ways. He used his newfound abilities to goof off, to pull of tricks, to be higher than others, to try to get what he wanted by placing himself above them. Each time, it brought him only misery, and repeated suicide attempts. Then, he had a break and began to be reborn. 
Unfortunately, the old man dies at the hospital, but Phil tries to save him again the next day. Does Phil manage to break the time loop? This experience humbles Phil, and the next Groundhog Day morning, he gives a heartfelt speech during his reporting, impressing Rita. Rita asks him out for coffee, but he declines, citing some errands. 
Groundhog Day follows Bill Murray’s character, Phil Connors, a TV weatherman who becomes mysteriously trapped in a time loop during a reporting trip to Punxataney, PA, for the town’s annual  
The cause and end of the time loop in Groundhog Day (1993) What caused the time loop of Groundhog Day (1993) is the cynicism of Phil Connors and the weather storm he wrongly predicted that trapped him and his coworkers in the town of Punxsutawney, Philadelphia. Phil Connors constantly relives the same day and experiences highs and lows while  
Phil's character arc and transformation, as well as gaining Rita's approval, are what ultimately bring an end to the time loop. At the end of Groundhog Day, Phil Connors learns to use the time he has to enhance his life and use his abilities to help others, making him a popular figure in Punxsutawney, finally winning the heart of Rita, and  
Punxsutawney Phil controls the time loop. The Seer of Seers and Prognosticator of Prognosticators was deeply offended when Connors called him a "large squirrel predicting the weather." Phil isn't a squirrel and he isn't predicting shit. He's a motherfucking groundhog and he decides when the seasons change. 
Then in March 1985, he contracted a virus that attacked regions of his brain, causing a unique and profound form of amnesia. He was able to play complex piano scores, yet his episodic memory lasted 7 to 30 seconds. In short, he was stuck in a strange and maddening time loop. 
considering the various fields he had to learn (music, sculpting, poetry/literature, etc.) minus the time he spent goofing off in the time loop, this seems plausible in that amount of time. kind of like doing an undergrad, masters and some other two year diploma-he became an expert at getting past himself which was his real roadblock. 
It was implied in the movie that he did things over so many times, he tried to kill himself in as many different ways as possible, had enough time to become a literal master at pretty much everything, and had enough time separate the past two examples to get a perfect date with his female co-anchor word-for-word, retrying every time he so much  
In which case, the number of Groundhog Days that Phil looped through could be greatly increased if he wakes up at 6A every morning and it resets at midnight, then at most he can only experience 18 hours per day, meaning he needs to wake up to 5 mornings just to accumulate 4 full days of experience. 
He's a motherfucking groundhog and he decides when the seasons change. To punish Connors for his hubris, Punxsutawney Phil summoned a freak storm to trap him in his domain, then looped time until Connors learned his lesson. Remember, it's not until Phil Connors delivers his sincere monologue on the beauty of Groundhog Day that his curse is lifted. 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
He would just live one day and then move on to the following day without realizing he was stuck in a 10,00 year loop. The point of his mental state remembering every day was his punishment for not appreciating life and being a total douche bag until he realized this. 
The simplest answer: he was bored. He was already losing it cause literally nothing mattered; everything he did on groundhog day would be reversed in the morning. If you're stuck in a time loop for long enough I bet you'll turn crazy too. 
One of the most memorable sequences in the film is when Phil finally snaps, having lived the same day several times over. Out of frustration, he kidnaps the town's famous groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, and takes the police force on a wild chase through town.
