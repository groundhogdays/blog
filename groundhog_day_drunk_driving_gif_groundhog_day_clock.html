The 1993 Harold Ramis comedy "Groundhog Day" may not have spawned the hero-caught-in-a-time-loop genre,  After spending a night in jail for a drunk driving crash, Phil is returned peacefully to  
Phil's response to being arrested for driving recklessly with the groundhog reflects his character development throughout the film "Groundhog Day." At the beginning, he is arrogant and self-centered, believing himself to be above consequences. However, as he relives the same day over and over, he learns humility and begins to care for others. 
(This mistake occurs in a single day, it is NOT about the difference between different days.) When Bill Murray has stolen the Groundhog and is driving away with it in the red truck, the police car and the TV van chase it. There is a shot of the red truck going under a low bridge, and then a long shot of all 3 vehicles.
