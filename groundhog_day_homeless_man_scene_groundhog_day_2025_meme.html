Given you were understandably likely bawling your eyes out, you may have missed a little nod hidden in the Groundhog Day scene where Phil tries to save the old homeless man from dying. 
In the end they left it ambiguous saying that it was how ever long it takes to learn to play the piano. He also doesnt save the kid in the tree everyday. One scene in the hospital you see the kid getting his broken arm fixed in the background. Great movie. The scene where Phil comes on to Ned was completely ad libbed by Murray. 
Happy Groundhog Day, everybody! Punxsutawney Phil did NOT see his shadow on Tuesday, meaning we're going to have an early spring  When Phil tries to save the homeless man. 
In Groundhog Day, Bill Murray catches that kid who falls out of the tree every day.  which compiles all the scenes with the elderly homeless man, he shows glimpses of his dramatic skills that  
Phil learns the fragility (and preciousness) of life through his repeated and futile attempts to save a dying, homeless old man whom he was mean to in the first years of his stay on Groundhog Day. This is especially heartbreaking because the old man looks EXTREMELY happy and grateful from the very first moment Phil meets him in the evening. 
For example, after his day with Rita, Phil helps an old homeless man he previously ignored. Whatever Phil does, each night the man dies. Ramis insisted on this scene because with death, “Phil confront[s] the reality that he’s not God, that his grandiosity is just a sham, and that you can only do so much in life.”

Groundhog Day is a 1993 fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin, and starring Bill Murray.Known for massively popularizing the time loop trope (to the extent that it's referred to on this site as the "Groundhog Day" Loop), cementing its namesake day into the modern lexicon as a stand-in for an unpleasant, repetitive situation, and serving as a  
Sequence revealing the main character's movement into socio-/world-centric circles of care and concern as he perceives himself part of the greater whole.

Between his age, the diseases and disorders he could have been suffering from, and the scientifically-proven effects of poverty upon the human body, the homeless old man was simply too far gone, health-wise, by February 2nd, 1993 to have ever lived to see February 3rd, no matter what Phil did or did not do during the loop. 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
A look at 17 stories surrounding the film 'Groundhog Day' in January 2023.
