Groundhog Day: Directed by Harold Ramis. With Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliott, Stephen Tobolowsky. A narcissistic, self-centered weatherman finds himself in a time loop on Groundhog Day. 
What day is this? Man in Hallway : It’s February 2nd. Groundhog Day. Phil: Yeah. I’m sorry. You know, I thought it was yesterday. (laughs) Man in Hallway: Oh.

Phil: "You want a prediction about the weather, you're asking the wrong Phil.

The elaborate loop-the-loop plot structure cooked up by screenwriter Danny Rubin is crystal-clear every step of the way, but it's Murray's world-class reactive timing that makes the jokes explode, and we end up looking forward to each new variation. He squeezes all the available juice out of every scene.

The origins of Groundhog Day can be traced back to ancient European weather lore. It is said that if a hibernating animal (often a bear or badger in Europe) emerges from its burrow on Candlemas Day (February 2nd) and sees its shadow due to clear weather, it will be frightened and return to its den, indicating six more weeks of winter.
