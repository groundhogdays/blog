        <p>Ned : Ryerson. "Needlenose Ned"? "Ned the Head"? C'mon, buddy. Case Western High. Ned Ryerson: I did the whistling belly-button trick at the high school talent show? Bing! Ned Ryerson: got the shingles real bad senior year, almost didn't graduate? Bing, again. 
Groundhog Day - Ned Ryerson!: The persistent Ned Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky) tries to jog Phil's (Bill Murray) memory about their high school years.BUY THE  
The whole playlist of Groundhog Day (1993):  below:=====0:00 fumbling around 
It’s Groundhog Day, everyone – and in addition to letting a rodent tell us if we’ll suffer through another six weeks of winter, it’s also the perfect day to look back at the best quotes from that annoying former high school classmate-turned-insurance-salesman who pesters Bill Murray’s character Phil Connors into buying life insurance in the classic 1993 film “Groundhog Day.” 
All the ned scenes. The annoying old school friend who you don't remember pestering you to buy insurance.. 
A great memorable quote from the Groundhog Day movie on Quotes.net - Ned: Phil? Phil Connors? Phil Connors, I thought that was you. Now don't you tell me you don't remember me 'cause I sure as heckfire remember you. Phil: Not a chance. Ned: Ned Ryerson. "Needlenose Ned"? "Ned the Head"? C'mon, buddy. Case Western High. 
Ned the Head? Well, you're in good company — Phil Connors didn't recognize Ned either when he bumped into him on his way to do the Groundhog Day report. But by the second February 2, he knew  
The 25th anniversary of "Groundhog Day" is a great chance to listen to some fascinating stories from the set, told by Ned Ryerson actor Stephen Tobolowsky 
Groundhog Day (1993) - * Ned: [recognizes Phil and runs up to him on the street] Phil? Hey, Phil? Phil! Phil Connors? Phil Connors, I thought that was you! * Phil: [thinking Ned's just a watcher of the local news] Hi, how you doing? Thanks for watching. * [Starts to walk away] * Ned: Hey, hey! Now, don't you tell me you don't remember me because I sure as heckfire remember you. * Phil  
Groundhog Day (1993) clip with quote Needlenose Ned. Ned the Head. Yarn is the best search for video clips by quote. Find the exact moment in a TV show, movie, or music video you want to share. Easily move forward or backward to get to the perfect clip. 
Starring Bill Murray as Phil Connors, a cynical weatherman who finds himself reliving the same day over and over again, Groundhog Day mixes humor with philosophical themes. Alongside Murray, the film stars Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliott. Groundhog Day received critical acclaim upon release and has since become a cultural touchstone. 
Groundhog Day's Time Loop Begins With Ned Ryerson According to the theory, the time loop begins the first time Phil runs into Ned and is intended to get him to sign a contract. They're supposedly friends from high school, but Phil doesn’t recognize him, thinking the man is a fan instead. 
Hilarious underrated comedy starring Bill Murray who keeps re-living the same day over and over again. If you like the clips, you can pick up the movie here: 
[Groundhog Day] Ned Ryerson is the devil, and he imprisons Phil Conners in the time loop when Phil refuses to purchase Ned's insurance.  Phil's head is illuminated  
The "first step" Ned refers to literally the first step Phil takes after being placed into the time loop, and Ned is laughing at the irony that Phil's first step was so unpleasant. It's a cruel irony that only Ned is fully able to enjoy. Secondly: On the last day of the loop we see that Phil has purchased insurance from Ned, much to Ned's pleasure. 
PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa.—Actor Stephen Tobolowsky, best known for playing the annoying Ned Ryerson in the cult classic Groundhog Day, was invited to Punxsutawney for Groundhog Day 2010 by its  
Groundhog Day, the 1993 film Ramis directed and co-wrote with Danny Rubin, became an underground Buddhist classic, despite the fact that the words “Buddhist” or “Buddha” never appear in the script, or that neither Ramis nor Rubin intended it to be Buddhist or Christian or Jewish or any of the other denominations that say it speaks to  
On mobile so can't find it, but someone else has written up a different theory about Groundhog Day actually being Ned's day repeating and Phil somehow got stuck in it. Him buying life insurance was the one "change" needed to stop the cycle. I suggest reading it if you have a chance. It's good just like this one. 
Groundhog Day is a beloved comedy film that has stood the test of time, and one of the standout characters is Ned Ryerson. Played by Stephen Tobolowsky, Ned Ryerson is a quirky and persistent insurance salesman who is always trying to sell policies to the film’s protagonist, Phil Connors. 
In honor of Punxsutawney Phil and Groundhog Day, the holiday, we've resurrected some of the best "Groundhog Day" quotes from the famous comedy movie. Poor Phil Connors (played with excellent drollness by Bill Murray) was forced to wake up day after day, reliving each run-in with Needlenose Ned, his producer Rita, and his cameraman, Larry. </p>
