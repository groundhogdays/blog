        <p>The Groundhog Day Diet: Why I Eat the Same Thing Every Day For the past five years, I’ve eaten pretty much the same thing every single day. Every morning for the last 1,825 some odd days, I’ve eaten an egg scramble (1 whole egg + 8 ounces of egg whites) + 1 oz of cheddar cheese + 2 Xtreme Wellness High Fiber Low Carb Tortilla Wraps. 
See how the groundhog became a symbol for predicting seasonal changes in America, rooted in German folklore with a badger — which in turn lead to Groundhog Day.

Countless celebrities swear by the so-called “Groundhog Day diet.” It’s a pretty simple concept: eat the same dish every day. Not necessarily for the same meal each day, let alone for every meal. But the idea is to embrace the predictability and potential nutritional benefits of plugging and playing something over and over again. 
What is Groundhog Day and when is it? Groundhog Day is celebrated on Monday, Feb. 2 this year. People far and wide travel to Gobbler’s Knob to witness Phil's prediction. 
Groundhog Day has been celebrated in the United States since at least February 2, 1886. Starting in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, with its now-famous groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, the tradition spread throughout America. It is now celebrated all over, and not just with groundhogs.

What Phil learns in the movie Groundhog Day can help us better achieve eating and exercise goals. Changing this one thing can be game-changing. 
Groundhogs prefer to live in places where they can dig easily. Their burrows usually have two entrances. They have a central hole with plenty of soil around it and a secondary hole hidden by vegetation. Woodchucks are diurnal and usually forage for food during the day. However, they never wander too far away from their homes, usually not more  
Cottage cheese or soy skyr with neutral protein powder and maple syrup flavor drops is my breakfast every day (yeay protein). It's delicious, creamy, and keeps me full forever because of the massive protein boost, but also saves up cal and carbs for dinner.

Groundhogs prefer eating younger, more tender plant leaves over mature foliage. Tough, stringy greens are harder to digest. In a single day, a groundhog consumes about 1/3 of its body weight in food. That’s like a 150-pound human eating 50 pounds of food per day! Groundhogs have two coats of fur – a dense grey undercoat and longer brown
