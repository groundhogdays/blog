Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
Brian Murray (born October 31, 1945), known professionally by his stage name as Brian Doyle-Murray, is an American actor, comedian and screenwriter. He has appeared with his younger brother, actor/comedian Bill Murray , in several films, including Caddyshack , The Razor's Edge , Scrooged , Ghostbusters II , and Groundhog Day . 
Brian Doyle Murray may be most recognizable for his part opposite Bill in Groundhog Day, but he’s got a long list of credits as both a writer (SCTV, SNL, Caddyshack) and actor (recurring roles  
Groundhog Day: Directed by Harold Ramis. With Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliott, Stephen Tobolowsky. A narcissistic, self-centered weatherman finds himself in a time loop on Groundhog Day. 
I knew Bill and Brian a little bit before “Groundhog Day” because I came up with their brother, Joel, and I’m such a huge fan of Brian Doyle-Murray. We later got to work on a show called “Lodge 49,” and I have a memory of watching him in a little cabaret in Chicago, Crosscurrents, when we were working with Del Close . 
When it was released in 1993, 'Groundhog Day' was only a modest success at the box office. But thanks to a hilarious lead performance from Bill Murray, an original script cowritten and directed by Harold Ramis and a cast that includes familiar faces like Chris Elliott and Andie MacDowell, it has gone on to become a comedy classic. 
Brian Doyle-Murray is the brother of Bill Murray and Joel Murray. He got his start as a regular cast member on Saturday Night Live. Doyle-Murray has appeared in many films, such as Scrooged, Caddyshack, and Groundhog Day. Terminal Reality Creative Director Drew Haworth came up with a plan B to get Bill Murray on board with Ghostbusters: The Video Game: Brian Doyle-Murray. David Margulies was  
After Groundhog Day, Doyle-Murray appeared in Bakersfield P.D. and The George Wendt Show in the mid-'90s, going on to pick up roles in As Good as It Gets (1997), Snow Dogs (2002), and 17 Again (2009). 
We have a big Groundhog Day celebration every year, the groundhog is every local shop’s mascot, there’s a Pokémon Go gym that’s just “where Bill Murray crashed his car in Groundhog Day.” Another fun fact: the exterior shots of Bill Murray’s hotel is actually the historic Woodstock Opera house, where shows are put on regularly. 
Joel Murray was born in Wilmette, Illinois USA, on 17 April 1963 – his zodiac sign is Aries and he holds American nationality. He is an actor , film writer and producer, who is perhaps known best for his portrayal of Frank, one of the lead characters in the 2011 crime comedy “God Bless America” written and directed by Bobcat Goldtwait  
Brian Doyle-Murray is the third-oldest Murray child, whom you may recognize from several films also featuring Bill, including Caddyshack (which he also co-wrote), Groundhog Day, and Scrooged. Brian is 75 years old and has been married to his wife, Christina Stauffer, since 2000. 
Murray first gained prominence on Saturday Night Live from 1977 to 1980, earning an Emmy Award for his work. His film career took off in the late 1970s and 1980s with hits like Meatballs, Caddyshack, Ghostbusters and Groundhog Day. Murray also ventured into screenwriting and directing, co-directing Quick Change. 
Murray starred in iconic films like Ghostbusters, Groundhog Day, and Lost in Translation. He is known for his dry humor and unique acting style.  Joel Murray: The  
Jay Dysart is phenomenal in the lead, a Phil Connors with a more frenetic, brittle edge than the stillness of Murray’s film version. As the musical unfolds you watch his Connors spin through detached disbelief to detached hedonism to acceptance of his fate without ever feeling less attached to his arc.Repetition is an art of infinite variety as it’s practiced by Jay Dysart in GROUNDHOG DAY
