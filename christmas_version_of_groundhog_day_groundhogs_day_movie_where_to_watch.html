        <h2><strong>christmas version of groundhog day groundhog day bgg</strong></h2>
        <p>12 Dates of Christmas is a festive version of Groundhog Day with maybe a bit of A Christmas Carol thrown in. Amy Smart is reliving her Christmas Eve as she wakes up each time on the floor of a department store. She is selfish, self obsessed and rude. 
"Christmas Again," starring Scarlett Estevez in a movie with a "Groundhog's Day" spin, premiers on Disney Channel and Disney+ Friday. FULL STORY:  
It is based on the short story Christmas Every Day by William Dean Howells and takes inspiration from Groundhog Day. Preteen Rowena "Ro" Clybourne (played by Scarlett Estevez) is a high-spirited 12-year-old who is determined to have the best Christmas ever at all costs, in an attempt to help her divorced parents reconcile. 
Christmas Do-Over: Directed by Catherine Cyran. With Jay Mohr, Daphne Zuniga, David Millbern, Adrienne Barbeau. Kevin tries to be involved with his son and ex-wife's family for Christmas. 
Christmas on Repeat and A Chance for Christmas are both from 2022, and both have Santa-induced time loops. Both also have white main female characters involved with a black man and in one the protagonist is an Internet influencer and in the other one the protagonist is making a commercial with an Internet influencer. 
Christmas Do-Over brings the time loop concept to the holiday season, with a protagonist reliving Christmas Day repeatedly. The film's focus on personal redemption and improving relationships within a repetitive cycle captures the heartwarming journey seen in Groundhog Day , with a festive twist. 
Jack Frost is a 1979 Christmas, Winter and Groundhog Day stop motion animated television special produced by Rankin/Bass Productions. [2] It is directed by Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin Jr., written by Romeo Muller, narrated by Buddy Hackett, and starring the voices of Robert Morse, Debra Clinger and Paul Frees. [3] 
The film fantasy has her in a holiday version of "Groundhog Day," living "Christmas Again" over and over until she gets it right. I think I would describe Ro as a very mischievous, and headstrong  
After a mean outburst toward all her family members, Rowena runs outside to escape. She runs into Santa, and laments that she wants Christmas to go back to the way things used to be before her parents separated. Santa takes her request for a Christmas do-over quite literally, and the next morning Rowena finds that Christmas Day is repeating itself.

Kevin tries to be involved with his son and ex-wife's family for Christmas. During dinner, he thought his Christmas *day* couldn't be more screwed; his son suddenly wishes it was Christmas every day. After that, it was a regular Groundhog's Day. Kevin learns new dance moves and can actually sing. Don't let the caroling fool you. 
It was a very sweet Christmas version of Groundhog Day. I listened to the audiobook version, and I liked the narrator. This is a clean romance no smut, very hallmark movie type of story. My favorite part of this was the found family aspect along with the romance. 
The Groundhog Day inspirations are obvious in this movie, but it feels fresh with how the time loop mechanic is used as a source of dark humor, cathartic change, and character development. Both Samberg and Milioti bring tons of fun and chemistry to their roles, making Palm Springs one of the most enjoyable in the genre. 
A Not So Merry Christmas is a Mexican film directed by Mark Alazraki, starring Mauricio Ochmann and Ana Brenda Contreras. A Mexican version of Groundhog Day (1993), this Netflix production starts well (with a musical number of dance and Christmas carols) and gradually becomes more and more deflated consumed by the inevitable Christmas spirit. 
Today all across the US and Canada, many communities celebrate their own version of Groundhog Day. In Canada alone, there are a half dozen places with a Groundhog Day tradition. In French Canada the day is called Jour de la marmotte. “Fred la marmotte of Val-d’Espoir” has been the winter forecaster for the province of Quebec since 2009.

Jay Dysart is phenomenal in the lead, a Phil Connors with a more frenetic, brittle edge than the stillness of Murray’s film version. As the musical unfolds you watch his Connors spin through detached disbelief to detached hedonism to acceptance of his fate without ever feeling less attached to his arc.Repetition is an art of infinite variety as it’s practiced by Jay Dysart in GROUNDHOG DAY
