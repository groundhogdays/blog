        <p>Only in terms of the stuck-in-time thing. Please don't give away any big plotlines or any spoilers but I love that sort of plot (like with the trickster/angel in s3 I think, if you watch Supernatural) of stuck in time.

Redditors provided a variety of movie recommendations similar to Groundhog Day, including romantic comedies, sci-fi thrillers, and Netflix series. Some of the recommended movies were well-received by the community, while others were less popular. 
If, like the rest of us, you watched the trailer and believed that this was going to be a mere Groundhog Day rip-off featuring that obnoxious guy from Brooklyn Nine-Nine, you too would be dead wrong. 
Why you'll like this movie: Happy Death Day cleverly combines horror, humor, and a time loop premise, creating a unique and thrilling counterpart to Groundhog Day. The protagonist's quest to solve her own murder within a repeating day mirrors Phil Connors' journey of self-improvement, balancing suspenseful mystery with comedic elements. Premise: 
While there have been plenty of time loop movies over the years, many have used the concept to dramatic effect, like in 12 Monkeys and Source Code.However, the classic 1990s comedy Groundhog Day helped popularize the time loop comedy subgenre in which a character is stuck reliving the same day over and over again until they figure out how to break the loop, leading to all kinds of hijinks as  
The Groundhog Day inspirations are obvious in this movie, but it feels fresh with how the time loop mechanic is used as a source of dark humor, cathartic change, and character development. Both Samberg and Milioti bring tons of fun and chemistry to their roles, making Palm Springs one of the most enjoyable in the genre.

Tree Glebman is Jess in this scenario, but while the latter functioned amidst a bleaker tone, the former revels in a more darkly comic and absurdist backdrop.

Groundhog Day is easily my favorite movie, and my other favorite movies have a very similar feel. Hook with Robin Williams, and Yes Man with Jim Carrey are really good. It also helps when a funny person is the lead like Bill Murray. 
Groundhog Day (1993) A few days ago I made a post about which Bill Murray movie people thought was his best one, and it brought up a lot of good conversations. Groundhog Day was brought up a lot and rightfully so. I haven’t watched Groundhog Day in a little while so I decided to watch it again today on this lazy Saturday. 
I'm highly interested in movies with plot revolving around traveling back in time while retaining all your memories. Perfect example is movie Groundhog Day, repeating some time segment until you get the things right. On top of my head I can think about Back to the Future and Edge of Tomorrow. Do you know any similar movies? Thank you.

Groundhog Day is pretty unique, but I'll put a couple out there. I saw the trailer for this the other day: +1. Like Groundhog Day in that apparently the characters manipulate events that are somehow repeating. Can't vouch for it personally but it had moderately good reviews. Also try Timecrimes, which is more time travel loops. 
10 votes, 17 comments. I've been meaning to find movies like Groundhog Day, ones that are not similar in concept, but similar in like a fun 90s 
Like the main character hears someone narrate his life, or the main character waking up on Groundhog Day everyday. It just happens. Sure, in the Groundhog Day script it was written that a bitter ex put some sort of time loop curse on Phil Connors. </p>
