        <p>The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
See how the groundhog became a symbol for predicting seasonal changes in America, rooted in German folklore with a badger — which in turn lead to Groundhog Day. 
The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The annual ritual has roots in pre-Christian traditions and was brought to the U.S. by  
Groundhog Day, in the United States and Canada, day (February 2) on which the emergence of the groundhog from its burrow is said to foretell the weather for the following six weeks. The beginning of February, which falls roughly halfway between the winter solstice and the spring equinox , has long been a significant time of the year in many  
"Groundhog Day is really a holiday about sex," he adds. Blumstein says all animals, not just the prognosticators, deserve respect. While some people consider groundhogs a nuisance because they  
Groundhog Day in Pop Culture. Groundhog Day has made its mark in pop culture, thanks to movies, TV shows, and more. Here are some interesting facts about its influence. The movie "Groundhog Day" has become a cultural phenomenon, often referenced in discussions about time loops and repetitive events. 
In 1993, the film Groundhog Day starring Bill Murray popularised the use of the term ‘groundhog day’ to mean something that is endlessly repeated.It also popularised the event itself: after the film came out, the crowd at Gobbler’s Knob grew from around 2,000 annual attendees to a staggering 40,000, which is nearly 8 times the population of Punxsutawney. 
What happens on Groundhog Day? On Feb. 2 each year, members of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, established in 1887, make their way to Pennsylvania’s Gobbler’s Knob,  
Many years later, and we’re still looking to Punxsutawney, and, of course, its top groundhog, Phil, to indicate whether or not we should bundle up or pack away the parkas. And The Farmer’s Almanac says Phil is a crisp 130 years old, so he should be a pretty reliable source at this point. 
As the sun rose on Groundhog Day today, the region’s top furry forecasters all agreed that an early spring is on the horizon.While modern meteorologists may put more faith in weather satellites  
The radical animal rights group PETA is at it again—this time demanding that Pennsylvania’s beloved weather-predicting groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, be retired and replaced with a vegan “weather reveal cake,” as reported by The New York Post. Yes, you read that right. 
The groundhog is known as Punxsutawney Phil, because the town where the Groundhog Day tradition originated is called Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. A big celebration is still held in the town to this  
Groundhog Day should be on everyone’s bucket list. Groundhog Day is held at Gobbler’s Knob, a field a little under two miles outside of downtown Punxsutawney, PA. The gates to the grounds open at 3am. No tickets are required as Groundhog Day is a free event. From 3am until approximately 7:20am, a party happens at Gobbler’s Knob. 
Groundhog Day takes place every year in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, where the resident groundhog makes his prediction on the remaining winter. 
The Legacy of Groundhog Day. Groundhog Day’s enduring popularity stems from its combination of folklore, community spirit, and humor. It offers a moment of levity in the depths of winter and connects people to nature and the changing seasons. Bill Murray Groundhog Day. The holiday gained additional cultural significance with the 1993 film  
Its premise is simple — Murray plays a weatherman, named Phil Connors, that becomes trapped in a time loop on Groundhog Day. Part of what makes this movie so great is the script and all of these famous Groundhog Day quotes.

Originally, Groundhog Day was a Celtic festival marking the year’s first cross-quarter day, or a midpoint between seasons. Read more about the ancient Celtic calendar here. Celebrated at the beginning of February, the day was called Imbolc —a term from Old Irish that is most often translated as “in the belly”—a reference to the soon  
Given that Phil was in this time loop for decades. I'm sure he tried everything. They can't realistically show every day in the space of a 90 minute movie.
