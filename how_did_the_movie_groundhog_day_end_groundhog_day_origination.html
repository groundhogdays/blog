The 1993 Harold Ramis comedy "Groundhog Day" may not have spawned the hero-caught-in-a-time-loop genre, but it certainly prodded it to life. To this day, the film carries a 97% rating from critics  
For example, it could be said that many movies announce the premise of the story in the first scene. In this case, I think that this is more than a movie where the time repeats itself, its a movie about a selfish guy who has to learn to be open to the (sometimes chaotic) experience of living, and really share with other people. 
Groundhog Day is observed on February 2, according to the local legend, a day when the groundhog comes out of hibernation, and the locals determine the season change following this event. “ [I]f the groundhog wakes and sees his shadow, we’ve got six more weeks of winter to look forward to,” Connors explains. 
They arrive in town a day before the festival, and Phil’s Groundhog Day starts early at 6 am. The morning kicks off with Phil listening to a weather report on the radio, which predicts a blizzard in Punxsutawney. Phil reluctantly dresses for Groundhog Day and feels disdain for the festival and its concept. 
7. The movie was added to the United States National Film Registry: In 2006, Groundhog Day was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress, highlighting its cultural, historical, and aesthetic significance. 12 FAQs about Groundhog Day Movie: 1. Is Groundhog Day based on a true story? 
Every day he befriends an elderly dying homeless man, catches a boy falling from a tree, performs a lifesaving Heimlich Maneuver, encourages a soon-to-be-married couple having cold feet, etc. During his busy day, he learns to play the piano and ice sculpt, and falls in love with Rita . 
Ramis’ instincts were to make Groundhog Day more accessible, and the ending he gave the movie is perfect. Rubin’s twist is like the day where Phil convinces Rita that he is repeating February  
Well, Groundhog Day, the award-winning 1993 film directed by Harold Ramis, captures that feeling perfectly, but it initially had a very different ending. The critically acclaimed film sees Phil Connors ( Bill Murray ) — a weatherman from Pennsylvania who gets stuck in a never-ending time loop on Groundhog Day. 
Phil's character arc and transformation, as well as gaining Rita's approval, are what ultimately bring an end to the time loop. At the end of Groundhog Day, Phil Connors learns to use the time he has to enhance his life and use his abilities to help others, making him a popular figure in Punxsutawney, finally winning the heart of Rita, and

Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly.

Groundhog Day had many people rolling in laughter when it came out in 1993, just as it does today. Perhaps the most memorable aspect of this film is the brand of comedy embodied by Bill Murray’s  
Bill Murray could have woken up on Groundhog Day in Mineral Point, Wisconsin, not Woodstock. The town came close to becoming the film location for Murray’s iconic 1993 film, “Groundhog Day.” As anyone with any knowledge of either the film or Woodstock knows, Murray’s character ended up repeating his day in Woodstock. 
The movie Groundhog Day relies on physical comedy and that was also a possible point of contention for Murray. During the snowball fight scene, Ramis apparently instructed the kids to give it
