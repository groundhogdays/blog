When a black man lives the same day over and over again, he tries changing his behavior to survive a police interaction.Writer/Director: Cynthia KaoDP: Coope 
The story was twice adapted by Hollywood, first in 1990 as a short film, and again in 1993 as a television movie. Lupoff appeared in both films as an extra. [1] The major plot device is a time loop or time bounce, and bears great similarity to that of 1993's Groundhog Day. Lupoff and Jonathan Heap, director of the 1990 film, were "outraged" by  
Groundhog Day for a Black Man: Directed by Cynthia Kao. With Matt Cordova, Celia Finkelstein, Marshall Givens, Burl Moseley. When a black man lives the same day over and over again, he tries to change his behavior in order to survive a police interaction. 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly.

Well, what a GHD fuelled day this has turned out to be! While reading up about Groundhog Day For A Black Man I came across claims that the idea was stolen and turned into Two Distant Strangers. Always being able to find half an hour for a short film — and having a Netflix subscription — I hit search and gave it a watch to make up my own mind. 
The competition, which occurred Wednesday night, was stiff as the nine short films and web series presented were amazingly crafted and thoughtful entries, but the two shorts that came out on top were Cynthia Kao’s Groundhog Day For A Black Man and Cullan Bruce’s Lost Dogs. 
In a TikTok posted by director Cynthia Kao, the director talked about her four-minute short film titled "Groundhog Day for a Black Man," released in December 2016, in which a Black man relives the  
In April 2021, Cynthia Kao posted a video on the social media site TikTok alleging that this film plagiarized a short film she had directed in December 2016 titled Groundhog Day For a Black Man. [9] The contents of Kao's film were similar to the plot of Two Distant Strangers , which are both about a black man trying to relive the same day over  
12:01 PM: Directed by Jonathan Heap. With Jane Alden, Don Amendolia, John Bachelder, Laura Harrington. Myron Castleman is stuck reliving the same 59 minutes of his lunch break. 
The movie is basically a comedy, but there’s an underlying dynamic that is a little more thoughtful. Like “Scrooged,” Murray’s dreary 1988 film, this is a movie about a grouch in the process of self-redemption: A supernatural force is showing him his weaknesses. 
Groundhog Day (1993). Saturday, Feb. 1 at The Main Cinema; Sunday, Feb. 2 at Insight Brewing; and Sunday, Feb. 2 at Alamo Drafthouse. It's an appropriate time to revisit the February holiday classic. 
People only read "Ground Hog Day" they didn't read "for a black man" that youtube short film by Cynthia Kao was brilliant but unfortunately didn't get enough recognition until last year even thought it came out in 2016. The 30 min short wasn't that bad. 
The second film adaptation of the short story "12:01 PM" by Richard A. Lupoff, which was published in 1973 in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. Office worker Barry Thomas is forced to relive the worst day of his life. [11] Groundhog Day: 1993 
The movie, as everyone knows, is about a man who finds himself living the same day over and over and over again. He is the only person in his world who knows this is happening, and after going through periods of dismay and bitterness, revolt and despair, suicidal self-destruction and cynical recklessness, he begins to do something that is alien to his nature. 
Happy Death Day is a slasher-horror film about college student Tree (played by Jessica Rothe), who's killed on her birthday and repeats that same day over and over. Every time she goes through the routine, Tree gets one step closer to finding out who her killer is—and escaping the time loop. 
The ‘ Groundhog Day ’ trope is having a moment. What are the odds that two films in recent memory, the original Hulu comedy ‘ Palm Springs’ being the other one, use the living the same day on repeat trick famed by the 1993 classic? To be fair ‘Palm Springs’ was made before the pandemic hit, but a coincidence in a year that felt like  
What Two Distant Strangers and Groundhog Day for a Black Man do share is an unabashed debt to Groundhog Day. Danny Rubin, the writer of that 1993 film, said he was unaware of this recent controversy, and hadn’t seen either short. But he said he was “delighted by all of the permutations” of his film’s concept. </p>
