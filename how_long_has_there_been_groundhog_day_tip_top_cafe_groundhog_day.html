The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The annual ritual has roots in pre-Christian traditions and was brought to the U.S. by  
Groundhog Day, in the United States and Canada, day (February 2) on which the emergence of the groundhog from its burrow is said to foretell the weather for the following six weeks. The beginning of February, which falls roughly halfway between the winter solstice and the spring equinox , has long been a significant time of the year in many  
Every year on February 2, crowds gather at Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to watch a groundhog emerge for the day—just like in the classic Bill Murray film Groundhog Day. You

In Punxsutawney, 1886 marked the first time that Groundhog Day appeared in the local newspaper. The following year brought the first official trek to Gobbler’s Knob. Each year since then has seen a steady increase in participation of the celebration from people all over the world. 
MACON, Ga. — Groundhog Day has been an annual tradition since the very first celebration was held on Feb. 2nd, 1877 in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. If the groundhog sees its shadow, there is six  
Crowds as large as 30,000 have turned out to Punxsutawney for multi-day Groundhog Day festivities, which the state calls a significant tourism boost for the town of fewer than 6,000 people. 
Since then, the tradition has grown in popularity, boosted by Bill Murray’s 1993 hit movie Groundhog Day, with many other cities across the country holding their own celebrations. But none are  
An unusual, yet beloved holiday February 2nd is Groundhog Day, the day when a groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil predicts whether or not we will have six more weeks of winter. If he sees his shadow, more cold is on the way; if not, warmer weather is coming. While this holiday may seem like a silly tradition, it has a surprisingly deep history. Ancient Traditions 
This winter has been harsh, especially in the Midwest and East Coast, but in just a few days, on Groundhog Day, we'll find out if we're going to find out we're going to have an extra long winter  
Groundhog Day infamously sticks Bill Murray in a time loop. It's clear he was there for a long time, but exactly how long?  "We figure the day had been repeating for about 10 years." 
Ramis once said Phil was trapped in Groundhog Day for 10 years, even though the original plan was to have him trapped for 10,000 years. According to the website Wolf Gnards, which ran the numbers, Phil was actually trapped for eight years, eight months and 16 days. 
This also could have been hundreds of years. No way to know really. There was also the line “I’ve dreamed of you every day of my life for 10,000 years, you have been my only weapon against despair” why would he lie? You have to believe he kept track, it’s one of the only things that can change, the number of days, and himself. 
Deeley declined to share how many groundhog Phil’s there have been, but the average groundhog living in captivity can live up to 10 years, according to the University of Michigan’s Museum of  
The website Obsessed With Film claims he was trapped 12,403 days, just under 34 years, in order to account for becoming a master piano player, ice sculptor, etc."

Punxsutawney Phil has been in charge of telling us how long winter will wear on (and, conversely, when spring will finally bloom) since 1887, all based on whether or not he sees his shadow on the  
Groundhog Day History:  It has a bushy tail up to 7 inches long.  Litters of one to nine have been recorded. The young stay with the mother for two to three months. </p>
