        <p>Ramis once said Phil was trapped in Groundhog Day for 10 years, even though the original plan was to have him trapped for 10,000 years. According to the website Wolf Gnards, which ran the numbers, Phil was actually trapped for eight years, eight months and 16 days. 
A lifetime."[48] In 2014, the website WhatCulture combined various time duration assumptions and estimated that Phil spent a total of 12,395 days—just under 34 years—reliving Groundhog Day.[49][50] 
How did they work it out? Well, there are 38 days actually shown on screen, as well as 414 days mentioned in the film and a huge 11,931 days which Phil spends learning a host of new talents and interests - based on the theory that it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert in any given subject. 
Article content. Nearly three decades after its premiere, the 1993 movie Groundhog Day has reached a new level of relevance under COVID-19. The world’s locked-down, working-from-home millions  
Phil experiences a mind-boggling amount of repeated days over the course of the film, and someone has actually taken the time to work out how long he was stuck living the same day over and over. The truth is even crazier than you might think – not to mention utterly terrifying. Bill Murray starred in Groundhog Day in 1993Columbia Pictures 
So, there you have it. The amount of time Bill Murray remains trapped in Groundhog Day’s time loop: 33 years, 350 days. Quite a bit longer than Wolf Gnards’ prediction or Ramis’ original 10 years, but certainly better than the 10,000 years the original script called for. 
How many Groundhog Days are actually in "Groundhog Day?" By Chris Taylor on February 2, 2021 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Flipboard 
What is Groundhog Day? People flock to Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, on Feb. 2 every year to be a part of the celebrations revolving around Punxsutawney Phil's winter forecast. 
In fact, the term "Groundhog Day" has become synonymous with both the phenomenon and the film trope of someone reliving the same day over and over in other movies like Groundhog Day. The film may be iconic for its brilliant utilization of the premise, but Groundhog Day 's ending still leaves many questions unanswered, including the exact number  
That's unrealistic considering the 40 or odd days we see on screen. According to him, it's over a lifetime, so 70~100 years minimum for a normal human life span. For Director Harold Ramis, a "sense" of 10 years. 10 years is long enough for a man to change and learn everything we see him learn. 
Groundhog Day (1993) A few days ago I made a post about which Bill Murray movie people thought was his best one, and it brought up a lot of good conversations. Groundhog Day was brought up a lot and rightfully so. I haven’t watched Groundhog Day in a little while so I decided to watch it again today on this lazy Saturday. 
Per IMDB, "On the DVD, Harold Ramis states that the original idea was for him to live February 2nd for about 10,000 years. Later he says that Phil probably lived the same day for about 10 years." OR "According to the website Wolf Gnards, Bill Murray spends 8 years, 8 months and 16 days trapped in Groundhog Day. 
107 votes, 40 comments. true. It’s my favorite movie of all time. It really explores character development in an interesting way, where the protagonist changes but the world stays the same. 
Also, according to the novel Edge of Tomorrow is based on, the sequence only takes place over 393 days. With that said, just like Groundhog Day, if we were to count every new day, we would still be missing the days they don't show. In Murray's case, we can infer many days are passing when he's seen being much better at the piano, or saving the  
I think Phil would've gone utterly insane in 10,000 years living the same day. Plus I think he would've had a much bigger reaction when it finally ended because it would be a massive shock to suddenly move to the next day after 10,000 years. You wouldn't even remember how things were prior to "groundhog day". 
I found this on IMBD for Ground Hog's Day "According to the website Wolf Gnards, Bill Murray spends 8 years, 8 months and 16 days trapped in Groundhog Day. The website Obsessed With Film claims he was trapped 12,403 days, just under 34 years, in order to account for becoming a master piano player, ice sculptor, etc." 
Organising the robbery from the armoured vehicle would've taken days if not weeks - same goes for learning the piano. Also a scene that really bugs me - he mentions having seen that Western film over 100 times, but does the film show more than once a day, and how many exactly is 'over 100'? 
there are some holes in this analysis. one is that he mastered each thing presented under the 10,000 hours rule. for instance, the french quote thing, that could take 3 days, the first date, the second to ask what he favorite poem is, and the last. keeping in mind that it is established that he mines her for personal facts. second, the things shown were just one instance. one ice sculpture, a
