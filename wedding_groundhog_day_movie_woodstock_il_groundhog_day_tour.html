        <h2><strong>wedding groundhog day movie groundhog day woodstock willie</strong></h2>
        <p>Palm Springs: Directed by Max Barbakow. With Andy Samberg, Cristin Milioti, J.K. Simmons, Peter Gallagher. Nyles and Sarah find themselves stuck in a time loop and living the same day over and over again. 
I must admit that I like Hallmark movies. This is a charming movie and it reminds me of the Bill Murray movie, "Groundhog Day" in which he relived that day over and over to get it right. As the trailer and title (I do, I do, I do) from this movie implies, the leading lady gets to relive her wedding day over and over until she gets it right. 
Office worker Barry Thomas is forced to relive the worst day of his life. [11] Groundhog Day: 1993: Self-centered television weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is forced to relive the same day over and over.

When we witness Sarah’s day, Palm Springs offers dual perspectives on a time loop. Each subsequent day makes the wedding hilariously worse, but Palm Springs starts out pretty far past Groundhog  
Palm Springs is a fun time loop comedy. Mainly because it assumes that the audience is familiar with the Groundhog Day concept so it hits the ground running. Nyles (Andy Samberg ) has been reliving the same day for ages. He goes to the wedding each day of a friend of his live in girlfriend Misty (Meredith Hagner) who is also cheating on him. 
Now imagine that you're trapped in a Groundhog Day scenario where every day you wake up on the day of that wedding. That's basically what happens in this charming and wacky movie, starring Andy  
Action movie star Tom Cruise puts in a performance that exceeds expectation in Edge of Tomorrow, a sci-fi movie that takes the concept of Groundhog Day and runs in a totally different direction, all while playing with action movie tropes to deliver something great.
