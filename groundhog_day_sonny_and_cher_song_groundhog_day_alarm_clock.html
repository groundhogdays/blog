        <p>It's 6 am. Rise and shine. And don't forget your booties 'cause it's cold out there today. It's cold out there every day. What is this, Miami Beach? 
I Got You Babe - Sonny &amp; Cher("Groundhog Day" - "Ricomincio Da Capo", 1993)YOU CAN BUY THE SOUNDTRACK HERE:  CAN BUY THE MOVIE HERE 
Every alarm clock sequence in Groundhog Day. 
"I Got You Babe" has been frequently featured in film and television, including Sonny and Cher's own series The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour. The song made a bit of a comeback when it was used repeatedly as Phil Connors (Bill Murray)'s wake-up music in the 1993 movie Groundhog Day. 
R.I.P. Mr. Bono, born Salvatore Phillip Bono {1935 - 1998} and Cher, born Cherilyn Sarkisian, will celebrate her 70th birthday come next May 20 {2016}. Barry from Sauquoit, Ny On August 25th 1965, the movie "Wild On The Beach"* opened in theaters across the U.S.A. Sonny and Cher appeared in the movie and performed a song titled "It's Gonna Rain" 
Here we go again, and again, and again. One of the running gags of the endlessly repeating loop of Bill Murray’s 90s film Groundhog Day features beleaguered weatherman Phil Conners waking up each day to Sonny and Cher’s 1965 oldies hit I Got You Babe, followed by this ‘chilling’ quote: “OK, campers, rise and shine, and don’t forget your booties, cause it’s cold out there. 
The soundtrack for Groundhog Day (1993) is one of the movie's most memorable elements. Featuring iconic tracks like Sonny &amp; Cher's “I Got You Babe” and Delbert McClinton's “Weatherman". "Pennsylvania Polka" made by Frankie Yankovic, helps to give the movie a fast pace and joyful melody that creates an uplifting atmosphere. 
Any doubts Danny Rubin had about his dream project were vanquished by Stephen Sondheim, who said “Groundhog Day” would make a good musical. That was in 2003. By then, Rubin and Harold Ramis  
So you can play Sonny and Cher’s “I got you babe” and enjoy in the facts and photos below. 1.Groundhog Day was not filmed in Punxsutawney. Photo via activerain 
The brilliance of Groundhog Day is that it manages to put you right in the middle of Phil’s perspective  right after the closing strains of Sonny and Cher’s relentlessly upbeat “I Got You  
Here we go again, and again, and again. One of the running gags of the endlessly repeating loop of Bill Murray’s 90s film Groundhog Day features beleaguered weatherman Phil Conners waking up each day to Sonny and Cher’s 1965 oldies hit I Got You Babe, followed by this ‘chilling’ quote: “OK, campers, rise and shine, and don’t forget your booties, cause it’s cold out there. 
But just like Phil Connors’ endless Feb. 2, the movie never really went away. In fact, it’s just gotten bigger—so big, in fact, that when most people hear the phrase “Groundhog Day,” they’re more liable to think of Sonny and Cher’s “I Got You Babe” than six more weeks of winter. 
[Verse 1: Bono &amp; Cher] They say we're young and we don't know We won't find out until we grow Well I don't know if all that's true 'Cause you got me, and baby, I got you [Chorus: Bono &amp; Both] Babe  
When an older and more haggard Phil from the film &amp;quot;Groundhog Day&amp;quot; once again wakes to the accursed Sonny and Cher song that has haunted him for too many mornings, he fears the worst -- that he&amp;#039;s been returned to his infinite, groundhog-centric time loop from over two decades ago. Upon stepping outside, he quickly outpaces the infamous Ned before catching sight of a 2020 Jeep  
Any doubts Danny Rubin had about his dream project were vanquished by Stephen Sondheim, who said “Groundhog Day” would make a good musical. That was in 2003. By then, Rubin and Harold Ramis

Over and over and over again, he wakes up at 6:00 am to the radio sound of Sonny and Cher's "I Got You Babe" and a series of encounters with his producer, Rita (Andie MacDowell), his cameraman (Chris Elliott), and an awkward insurance salesman (Stephen Tobolowsky) who knew him in high school.

In The Number Ones, I’m reviewing every single #1 single in the history of the Billboard Hot 100, starting with the chart’s beginning, in 1958, and working my way up into the present. 
The next day, Phil is woken by the sound of Sonny &amp; Cher's "I Got You, Babe" on his room's clock radio, and subsequently goes on to have a rather bad morning. After rather uninspiring conversation with his landlady, he runs into Ned, an old acquaintance whom he finds annoying and steps in a puddle of slush due to his hurry to get away from him. </p>
