        <h2><strong>how long did it take to film groundhog day the groundhog day soundtrack</strong></h2>
        <p>Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
Almost since the film’s release (which happened 10 days after Groundhog Day), it has obsessed fans and dogged the film’s cast and crew. Groundhog Day follows Bill Murray’s character, Phil  
Bill Murray's role as Phil Connors in 1993's Groundhog Day is one for the ages, especially considering he hated his experience behind-the-scenes just as much as his character did onscreen! 
The most false, when it comes to Groundhog Day, is the widely-reported notion that an early version of Rubin's script had Phil explicitly saying to Rita that he had been "waiting for you every day  
Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years. Deezen noted that the second draft of the screenplay called for Phil to be cursed to live the time loop for 10,000 years. [9] 
We see him relive Groundhog Day 38 times in the movie while another 414 days were mentioned in the film. Whatculture.com then used the theory that it takes 10,000 hours to master any one subject which brings his total to at least 12,395 days, assuming he mastered the piano, French poetry, and ice sculpting at different times. 
The film either took place over 10 years - or 10,000 Over the years, many people have weighed in on the amount of time grumpy weatherman Phil Connors was trapped reliving Groundhog Day in the film. The film’s director, Harold Ramis once stated it was ten years, but estimates have varied greatly - even writer Danny Rubins believed it would  
WhatCulture.com calculated just how long Phil Connors spent in limbo back in 2013 to mark the film's 20th anniversary. Amazingly, the time equates to repeating the same day a torturous 12,395 times. 
Groundhog Day: Directed by Harold Ramis. With Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliott, Stephen Tobolowsky. A narcissistic, self-centered weatherman finds himself in a time loop on Groundhog Day. 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis and written by Ramis and Danny Rubin. It stars Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliott. Murray portrays Phil Connors, a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2nd repeatedly. It was  
TIL the number of days Phil (Bill Murray's character) repeated Groundhog Day in the movie was 38, but in actual time it was calculated to be 8 years, 8 months and 16 days. 
We see him relive Groundhog Day 38 times in the movie while another 414 days were mentioned in the film. Whatculture.com then used the theory that it takes 10,000 hours to master any one subject which brings his total to at least 12,395 days, assuming he mastered the piano, French poetry, and ice sculpting at different times. 
The website Obsessed With Film claims he was trapped 12,403 days, just under 34 years, in order to account for becoming a master piano player, ice sculptor, etc." 
“I would say it was the catalyst that put Punxsutawney Phil from having 5,000 people come for Groundhog Day to having 35,000 people come for Groundhog Day. That was the impact that the movie had.“ 
I would hardly say he's pursued every life imagineable when he only has 24 hours to set anything up. I feel he would hold much more dear those things that take time, long-form arts like literature and film, and things that take collaboration with others. 
I’m still in the 7-12 years camp for total time spent, but I don’t think anybody watched the film more than 10 times to remember the various plot details and I don’t think it would take too long to memorize a single day of jeopardy. 
Phil experiences a mind-boggling amount of repeated days over the course of the film, and someone has actually taken the time to work out how long he was stuck living the same day over and over. The truth is even crazier than you might think – not to mention utterly terrifying. Bill Murray starred in Groundhog Day in 1993Columbia Pictures 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
According to actor Stephen Tobolowsky, Ramis told him that the entire progress of Groundhog Day covered 10,000 years. "I always thought that there were nine days represented [in the film], and Danny Rubin, the writer, said that he felt something like 23 days were represented in the movie, [but they lasted] over 10,000 years." 
This may be the source of the idea that Phil was stuck in Groundhog Day for 10,000 years. Movie commentary by the director. These quotes are from the Special 15th Anniversary Edition DVD of Groundhog Day, in the audio commentary by the director, Harold Ramis. 7:58 into the movie, in reference to the writer, Danny Rubin: He's something of a Zen  </p>
