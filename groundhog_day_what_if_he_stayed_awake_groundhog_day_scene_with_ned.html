        <h2><strong>groundhog day what if he stayed awake what to do for groundhog day</strong></h2>
        <p>Phil spends eight years, eight months and sixteen days stuck in groundhog day. There is one time where Phil stayed awake until six in the morning (the first night he spent with Rita) and the day reset itself anyway. 
Every morning, Phil wakes up at 6:00AM, and finds the day completely reset. In an effort to woo Rita and prove his story, he convinces Rita to spend the night, who mistakenly believes that the day resets at midnight. The two end up falling asleep before the day resets, and Phil wakes up to find himself alone. 
Not Groundhog Day, but in Palm Springs (a very similar movie) the character said he tried that using caffeine, meth, cocaine, anything to stay awake and he was able to make it for a few days but eventually fainted and was back at the start of the loop again

It's clearly established that Phil's day restarts at 6:00 AM. He wakes up in the bed and breakfast to Sonny &amp; Cher's "I Got You Babe," and the day begins the same way every single time (the weather discussion with the proprietor, meeting Ned, etc.). 
If Phil aged throughout his stay in Groundhog Day, he would likely retain something from the day before (e.g. if he was burned one day, the he'd have a telltale burn or scar the next day. Phil mentions to Rita, while they're in the cafe, that he no longer has to worry about his health, as he stuffs himself full of junk food and smokes a cigarette.

That scene does seem odd. During the rest of the movie, it seems as though when Phil falls asleep, the day resets. I would think the same thing would happen when he dies. It could be that the day resets at a particular time, like 4 in the morning the next day. We never see Phil awake at 4:00 AM. 
The groundhog is known as Punxsutawney Phil, because the town where the Groundhog Day tradition originated is called Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. A big celebration is still held in the town to this

Starring Bill Murray as Phil Connors, a cynical weatherman who finds himself reliving the same day over and over again, Groundhog Day mixes humor with philosophical themes. Alongside Murray, the film stars Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliott. Groundhog Day received critical acclaim upon release and has since become a cultural touchstone. 
Groundhog Day is such a clever, wonderful ride that you don't notice the joins. It's rare for a comedy to be funny and profound but also popular.  Groundhog Day is living proof that it's possible to create intelligent comedy that still has a broad appeal. 
Every child knows the basics of Groundhog Day. On February 2, the groundhog peeks out of his hole to decide if he wants to take the trouble of staying awake or if he would rather sleep in a while longer: If the sun is out, he casts a shadow that is apparently frightening enough that he promptly decides to return to the safety of his bed. 
The film is about a TV weatherman called Phil Connor, played by Ray Murray, who, for some unexplained reason, is stuck in a time loop and wakes up every day on the same day and in the same place: 2nd of February, Groundhog Day, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. 
Something that has always puzzled me about Groundhog Day: Why didn’t Connors just stay awake past 6 a.m.? That’s the point at which February 2 begins again and he wakes to the awful “I Got  
*Day 1: Eat every single disgustingly, yet delicious fatty food I could find *Day 2: Bareback it.no regrets *Day 3: Spend my life savings *Day 4: Do a news broadcast completely naked *Day 5: Repeat day 2 *Day 6: Buy 100 puppies and enjoy puppy bliss for a day *Day 7: At this point I would be out of ideas, so I'd probably end up jacking it 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin, and starring Bill Murray.Known for massively popularizing the time loop trope (to the extent that it's referred to on this site as the "Groundhog Day" Loop), cementing its namesake day into the modern lexicon as a stand-in for an unpleasant, repetitive situation, and serving as a  
Later he says that Phil probably lived the same day for about 10 years. According to the website Wolf Gnards, Bill Murray spends 8 years, 8 months and 16 days trapped in Groundhog Day. The website Obsessed With Film claims he was trapped 12,403 days, just under 34 years, in order to account for becoming a master piano player, ice sculptor, etc.

Buckeye Chuck is a weather-predicting groundhog in Marion, Ohio. In 1979, the Ohio legislature named Chuck the official groundhog for the Ohio state. Buckeye Chuck lives a comfortable, celebrity lifestyle — only working one day a year — but he doesn’t let the fame get to his head. </p>
