        <p>Every year, without a miss, we will hear if the groundhog saw, or did not see, his shadow. “Groundhog Day” — the Movie. A 1993 movie expanded on this “repeatability” nature of Groundhog Day. The movie, titled Groundhog Day, focused on a weatherman who was given the same assignment every year. For the fourth year in a row, he was sent

What came as a surprise to me is that Groundhog Day is actually the cultural melding of an ancient Christian festival with pagan superstition. February 2nd is forty days after Christmas, and from about the 4th Century, when the date of Christmas was fixed, the Christian Church celebrated on February 2nd the purification of the Virgin Mary and  
This is the complaint of the crabby weatherman Phil Connors, Bill Murray’s character in the 1993 film, Groundhog Day, after he finds himself perpetually living out the February 2nd holiday in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, his least favorite day of the year. 
Here are some scriptures that would work for Groundhog Day that talk about shadowy times, God’s light, and needing patience to receive God’s blessings: ISAIAH”© 9:2: THE “©PEOPLE”© WALKING “©IN “©DARKNESS”© HAVE “©SEEN “©A “©GREAT “©LIGHT; “©ON “©THOSE”© LIVING “©IN “©THE “©LAND”© OF  
We’d show up for school on a warm, spring day wearing a toboggan and gloves or we’d end up in shorts and flip-flops when there was snow on the ground. Of course no one really thinks a groundhog can predict the weather. No one decides how they’re going to dress or when they’ll go outside based on what the groundhog says.

Scripture for Today: Colossians 2:17 "These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality however is found in Christ." As of yesterday, Groundhog day has come and gone for this year.

I am writing this devotional on Groundhog Day in February. The day, of course, centers around a groundhog who foretells the weather. But what I think about most on this day is the hilarious movie, Groundhog Day, starring Bill Murray. 
Groundhog Day is a funny holiday, isn’t it? All across the country people watch a cute little groundhog come out of his hole just to find out if he can see his shadow. The tradition says if he sees his shadow, we’ll have six more weeks of winter weather, but if he doesn’t see it, we can expect an early spring.

He is always there to help us in times of trouble. – Psalm 46:1 (NIrV) Happy Groundhog Day! Groundhog Day isn’t a big holiday like Christmas or Thanksgiving, but just a silly day people celebrate just for fun. Here’s how it works. 
By Dr. Scott Toussaint February 2, 2017 August 30th, 2022 Devotional. No Comments. Today is February 2nd, traditionally known as Groundhog Day! It’s the day that we  
Groundhog Day, Luke 9:23, By James Moriello, Firm Foundation Christian Church, Woonsocket Daily Devotional, February 2, 2021 ‘Groundhog Day’, (Luke 9:23, NKJV) “If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow Me.” (Luke 9:23) Groundhog Day is observed every year on February 2nd. It is a  
When he wakes up the next morning, though, he finds he’s reliving the previous day—Groundhog’s Day. No one else seems to notice, so he assumes he’s merely having a bad dream. But when he wakes up again, he’s stuck living the same February 2. Phil’s trapped in a time loop from which he can’t escape. 
Pretty much everybody has seen Groundhog Day, in which Bill Murray plays a contemptible TV reporter who finds himself reliving the same day—Groundhog Day—over and over again. Each day begins with the radio alarm blasting Sonny and Cher’s “I Got You, Babe,” which in itself must represent one of the circles of Dante’s inferno. 
“Confront Your Shadow on Groundhog’s Day; Have you retreated from opportunity because of fear or uncertainty? Fear not; I will help you. (Isaiah 41:13) Sunlight glistens on his whiskers as Mr. Groundhog cautiously pokes his head above his earthy burrow.
