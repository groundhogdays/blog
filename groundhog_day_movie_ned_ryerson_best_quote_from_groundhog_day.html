        <p>Groundhog Day's Time Loop Begins With Ned Ryerson According to the theory, the time loop begins the first time Phil runs into Ned and is intended to get him to sign a contract. They're supposedly friends from high school, but Phil doesn’t recognize him, thinking the man is a fan instead. 
Groundhog Day - Ned Ryerson!: The persistent Ned Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky) tries to jog Phil's (Bill Murray) memory about their high school years.BUY THE  
"Needlenose Ned"? "Ned the Head"? C'mon, buddy. Case Western High. Ned Ryerson: I did the whistling belly-button trick at the high school talent show? Bing! Ned Ryerson: got the shingles real bad senior year, almost didn't graduate? Bing, again. Ned Ryerson: I dated your sister Mary Pat a couple times until you told me not to anymore? Well? 
Stephen Harold Tobolowsky (born May 30, 1951) is an American character actor and writer. He is known for film roles such as insurance agent Ned Ryerson in Groundhog Day [1] and amnesiac Sammy Jankis in Memento, as well as such television characters as Commissioner Hugo Jarry in Deadwood, Bob Bishop in Heroes, Sandy Ryerson in Glee, Stu Beggs in Californication and White Famous, "Action" Jack  
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
Ned Ryerson — I did the whistling belly-button trick at the high school talent show? Bing!  Ever since the movie "Groundhog Day" came out in the early '90s,

Groundhog Day's status as one of the best romantic comedies of all time means that occasionally, the depth of its fantastical element - the time loop - is overlooked. The theory goes that Ned Ryerson is actually the embodiment of the Devil, and that he deliberately traps Phil in the time loop as a form of punishment. 
Ned? Ned Ryerson?. You have to admit that Groundhog Day, the 1993 film starring Bill Murray (which he hated) and Andie MacDowell (who we haven't heard from in awhile), hits different this year.A  
The 25th anniversary of "Groundhog Day" is a great chance to listen to some fascinating stories from the set, told by Ned Ryerson actor Stephen Tobolowsky 
It’s Groundhog Day, everyone – and in addition to letting a rodent tell us if we’ll suffer through another six weeks of winter, it’s also the perfect day to look back at the best quotes from that annoying former high school classmate-turned-insurance-salesman who pesters Bill Murray’s character Phil Connors into buying life insurance in the classic 1993 film “Groundhog Day.” 
Hilarious underrated comedy starring Bill Murray who keeps re-living the same day over and over again. If you like the clips, you can pick up the movie here:

Ramis, Murray, and Stephen Tobolowsky (Ned Ryerson) have been honorary Grand Marshals in Punxsutawney on Groundhog Day. Other famous actors were considered for the lead of Phil Connors that director Harold Ramis thought were “too nice,” including Chevy Chase, Steven Martin, Robin Williams, and Michael Keaton. 
In the movie, the insurance salesman who pesters Phil is named Ned Ryerson. He continuously approaches Phil, trying to sell him insurance and reminding him of their shared past encounters, much to Phil's annoyance. Ned Ryerson's persistent and overly cheerful demeanor adds to the comedic element of the film. 
These unforgettable lines from Ned Ryerson in Groundhog Day have become iconic in their own right, adding to the charm and humor of the film. Stephen Tobolowsky’s portrayal of Ned Ryerson truly brings the character to life, making him a beloved part of the movie.
