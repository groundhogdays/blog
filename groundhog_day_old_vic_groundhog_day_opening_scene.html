Groundhog Day is the story of Phil Connors (Andy Karl), a cynical Pittsburgh TV weatherman who is sent to cover the annual Groundhog Day event in the isolated small town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, when he finds himself caught in a time loop, forced to repeat the same day again and

Warchus brings Groundhog Day to the Old Vic as part of his inaugural season as Artistic Director, with performances due to begin in July, playing until September 17th 2016.

The hit film about a TV weatherman’s endlessly reiterated day in small-town USA moved to the Old Vic stage in 2016; but then its progress became bumpy, despite the awards showered on it and its lead, Andy Karl, on both sides of the Atlantic. Karl was injured during a Broadway preview and the show's US tour didn't happen. 
Groundhog Day will run at The Old Vic from 20 May to 12 August 2023. The show’s songs are written by Tim Minchin and directed by The Old Vic’s artistic director Matthew Warchus – reuniting the duo following their smash-hit production of Matilda The Musical – which continues to pack in audiences at the Cambridge Theatre in London.
