        <p>How many Groundhog Days are actually in "Groundhog Day?" By Chris Taylor on February 2, 2021 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Flipboard 
In honor of Groundhog Day last week — when Punxsutawney Phil predicted an early spring (so we got that going for us [and, yes, I am mixing my Bill Murray movie references]) — Gallagher pinpointed the exact number of Groundhog Days Murray's Phil Connors endures in “Groundhog Day:” 12,403 days. 
Phil experiences a mind-boggling amount of repeated days over the course of the film, and someone has actually taken the time to work out how long he was stuck living the same day over and over. The truth is even crazier than you might think – not to mention utterly terrifying. Bill Murray starred in Groundhog Day in 1993Columbia Pictures 
According to WhatCulture.com — which meticulously took into account the 38 days actually shown during Groundhog Day; the 414 days that were mentioned; the 11,931 days Phil spent learning things like ice sculpting, French poetry, and playing the piano; and the days he spent performing good deeds — Harold's second estimate was much closer. 
These included the 38 "days shown on screen", the 414 "days mentioned" (including the "six months, four to five hours a day" spent throwing playing cards into a hat), and the colossal 11,931 "days  
Almost since the film’s release (which happened 10 days after Groundhog Day), it has obsessed fans and dogged the film’s cast and crew. Groundhog Day follows Bill Murray’s character, Phil  
So, there you have it. The amount of time Bill Murray remains trapped in Groundhog Day’s time loop: 33 years, 350 days. Quite a bit longer than Wolf Gnards’ prediction or Ramis’ original 10 years, but certainly better than the 10,000 years the original script called for. 
In fact, the term "Groundhog Day" has become synonymous with both the phenomenon and the film trope of someone reliving the same day over and over in other movies like Groundhog Day. The film may be iconic for its brilliant utilization of the premise, but Groundhog Day 's ending still leaves many questions unanswered, including the exact number  
Between 34 and 44 days. The first step in figuring out Phil's time loop is to answer an apparently simple question: How many Groundhog Days are shown on screen? But the answer is not as clear as you might think. You find yourself forced to make many interpretations about the available evidence. For example: 
What is Groundhog Day? People flock to Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, on Feb. 2 every year to be a part of the celebrations revolving around Punxsutawney Phil's winter forecast.

How can I celebrate 2025 Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney? While there are a handful of local celebrations of the holiday, the most well-known Groundhog Day event takes place on Feb. 2 in Punxsutawney. The Groundhog Day celebration is organized by the “ Inner Circle ” of the town’s “Groundhog Club.” These tuxedoed men in top hats conduct  
It certainly had a huge impact on the small town though. Groundhog Day celebrations went from seeing about 5,000 spectators every year to somewhere around 35,000. “I would say it was the catalyst that put Punxsutawney Phil from having 5,000 people come for Groundhog Day to having 35,000 people come for Groundhog Day. That was the impact that  
Of course, that number seems much higher than expected, seeing as the day shown on screen was 38 days, and that Connors “spent 11,931 days learning” in the entire process — which includes

I found this on IMBD for Ground Hog's Day "According to the website Wolf Gnards, Bill Murray spends 8 years, 8 months and 16 days trapped in Groundhog Day. The website Obsessed With Film claims he was trapped 12,403 days, just under 34 years, in order to account for becoming a master piano player, ice sculptor, etc." 
The Knob will be open February 1, the day BEFORE Groundhog Day, until 4:00pm. The Knob closes to vehicular and pedestrian traffic for site and festivity preparation. The Knob opens back up to vehicular traffic on February 2 nd around 10 am, after all buses have transported visitors off the Knob.

In answer to the title question, there are 34 days that are shown in the movie but years and years of days we don't see that are hinted at in the days we do see. In the movie Groundhog Day, Weatherman Phil Connors (played by Bill Murray), finds himself waking up to the same day over and over again. At first he takes advantage of the situation
