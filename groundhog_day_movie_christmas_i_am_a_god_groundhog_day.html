        <p>Christmas Do-Over: Directed by Catherine Cyran. With Jay Mohr, Daphne Zuniga, David Millbern, Adrienne Barbeau. Kevin tries to be involved with his son and ex-wife's family for Christmas. 
Kevin tries to be involved with his son and ex-wife's family for Christmas. During dinner, he thought his Christmas *day* couldn't be more screwed; his son suddenly wishes it was Christmas every day. After that, it was a regular Groundhog's Day. Kevin learns new dance moves and can actually sing. Don't let the caroling fool you. 
"Christmas Again," starring Scarlett Estevez in a movie with a "Groundhog's Day" spin, premiers on Disney Channel and Disney+ Friday. FULL STORY:  
Groundhog Day: 1993: Self-centered television weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is forced to relive the same day over and over. [12] This movie is generally seen as the quintessential time-loop movie by many with its name being synonymous with the genre as a whole. [13] [14] [15] Christmas Every Day: 1996 
This ABC family Christmas movie is better than some of the recent Hallmark holiday movies. The writing is sharper and the cast is likable - more A list for TV than usual. The Groundhog Day formula has been used in TV movies sometimes unsuccessfully, but here they got the right elements of Groundhog. 
Christmas on Repeat and A Chance for Christmas are both from 2022, and both have Santa-induced time loops. Both also have white main female characters involved with a black man and in one the protagonist is an Internet influencer and in the other one the protagonist is making a commercial with an Internet influencer. 
Christmas Do-Over brings the time loop concept to the holiday season, with a protagonist reliving Christmas Day repeatedly. The film's focus on personal redemption and improving relationships within a repetitive cycle captures the heartwarming journey seen in Groundhog Day, with a festive twist. Premise: 
Groundhog Day is such a great palate cleanser after Christmas because the holiday is already in the rearview mirror in this film. No one’s talking about Christmas when February 2 is the biggest  
1. Groundhog Day. This isn’t set around Christmas time but on February 2nd, or Groundhog Day. Bill Murray is hilariously brilliant in what is perhaps his finest role — a local weatherman doomed to relive the same day again and again. 
Without a doubt, Groundhog Day is the superior movie when comparing it to Scrooged. The 1993 film is more unique and shows off the actor's dramatic talents while including his comedic chops. Groundhog Day is the perfect balance of drama and comedy and is regarded as one of Murray's best projects (and one of the best movies of the 1990s). 
Before you say they rip-off Groundhog down, this is actually remake of Christmas Every Day (TV 1987) and also was remade again as Christmas Do over. This was really good and sweet movie, had a lot stuff happens in this movie, there funny moment as well. 
A Year from Now: Directed by Ricky Kennedy. With Trey Cartwright, Stef Cruz, Thomas Elam, Rosa Galarza-Mireles. In a twist on "A Christmas Carol" and "Groundhog Day" a woman experiences seven years of her future over the course of one week. 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
What do you get it you take a classic movie like the 1993 movie "Groundhog Day", spice it up with Christmas and add a pinch of Disney magic? Well, you get "Christmas Again". Yeah, that was essentially all that could be required to summarize this 2021 Christmas movie. 
Today Detective Brett Hopper will be accused of shooting state attorney Alberto Garza. He will offer his rock solid alibi. He will realize he's been framed. And he will run. Then he will wake up and start the day over again. Detective Charlie Crews was framed, convicted and cleared for a crime he  
While there have been plenty of time loop movies over the years, many have used the concept to dramatic effect, like in 12 Monkeys and Source Code.However, the classic 1990s comedy Groundhog Day helped popularize the time loop comedy subgenre in which a character is stuck reliving the same day over and over again until they figure out how to break the loop, leading to all kinds of hijinks as  
Christmas on Repeat and A Chance for Christmas are both from 2022, and both have Santa-induced time loops. Both also have white main female characters involved with a black man and in one the protagonist is an Internet influencer and in the other one the protagonist is making a commercial with an Internet influencer. 
I do, I do, I do (2015) - this was the one I watched years ago, it felt different now to watch it understand my current situation. It's an okay movie, like any standard Hallmark movie. Just feel like sharing, thought someone maybe interested in the Groundhog Day theme too. And if there are other Hallmark movies similar, please let me know! 
That’s exactly what happens in Netflix’s newest Christmas movie,  At first, Just Another Christmas seems like just another rip-off of Groundhog Day, as Jorge starts to anticipate every beat
