        <p>Phil explicitly admits this, and the spell's broken. I know of others' points that Rita was at the centre of it all, but I don't think she was that crucial, I'd rather say it had more to do with the groundhog and its shadow; the last day was the one that Phil didn't see his shadow. 
Groundhog Day follows Bill Murray’s character, Phil Connors, a TV weatherman who becomes mysteriously trapped in a time loop during a reporting trip to Punxataney, PA, for the town’s annual  
Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is an arrogant Pittsburg weatherman who looks down on everyone around him and treats his coworkers poorly. His least favorite part of the year is when the network sends him to cover Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, so when he finds he's stuck in an endlessly repeating Groundhog Day, it's a living nightmare. 
The premise of Groundhog Day (the movie) is brilliantly simple. Bill Murray plays weatherman Phil Connors, a sarcastic, egotistical narcissist who gets stuck in a time loop and is forced to relive  
Phil experiences a mind-boggling amount of repeated days over the course of the film, and someone has actually taken the time to work out how long he was stuck living the same day over and over. The truth is even crazier than you might think – not to mention utterly terrifying. Bill Murray starred in Groundhog Day in 1993Columbia Pictures 
Fans of the seasonal comedy classic "Groundhog Day" have wondered for decades how long Phil Conners spent reliving the same day — and there’s still no definitive answer. Columbia Pictures The film’s original commentary claimed Phil Connors was stuck for 10 years. 
They arrive in town a day before the festival, and Phil’s Groundhog Day starts early at 6 am. The morning kicks off with Phil listening to a weather report on the radio, which predicts a blizzard in Punxsutawney. Phil reluctantly dresses for Groundhog Day and feels disdain for the festival and its concept. 
What caused the time loop of Groundhog Day (1993) is the cynicism of Phil Connors and the weather storm he wrongly predicted that trapped him and his coworkers in the town of Punxsutawney, Philadelphia. Phil Connors constantly relives the same day and experiences highs and lows while trapped in this time loop. 
In fact, the term "Groundhog Day" has become synonymous with both the phenomenon and the film trope of someone reliving the same day over and over in other movies like Groundhog Day. The film may be iconic for its brilliant utilization of the premise, but Groundhog Day 's ending still leaves many questions unanswered, including the exact number  
But despite living many Groundhog Days in service to others — some theorize that he was stuck in Punxsutawney for as long as 10,000 years, according to Mashable – Phil's motives are still less  
Either way, today is Groundhog Day and in the 1993 film of the same name, Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is forced to live the same day over and over again, improving himself a little bit each and  
A lifetime."[48] In 2014, the website WhatCulture combined various time duration assumptions and estimated that Phil spent a total of 12,395 days—just under 34 years—reliving Groundhog Day.[49][50] 
Bill Murray's role as Phil Connors in 1993's Groundhog Day is one for the ages, especially considering he hated his experience behind-the-scenes just as much as his character did onscreen! Despite  
How did Phil get out of Groundhog Day? The end of Groundhog Day shows us that Phil Connors has finally succeeded in escaping from the seemingly endless repetition of February 2nd. We realize that his escape has been triggered by his transformation into a good person and by the fact that he is finally worthy of Rita’s love. 
After all, Phil is undeniably a jerk, but hey, he never murdered anyone. He's not a rapist. He didn't torture any small animals. Why Phil? Okay, here's the answer. The second draft of Groundhog Day says, actually, it was caused by Phil's scorned ex-girlfriend Stephanie. The second draft of Groundhog Day is pretty close to what we all see in the  
Plus I think he would've had a much bigger reaction when it finally ended because it would be a massive shock to suddenly move to the next day after 10,000 years. You wouldn't even remember how things were prior to "groundhog day". Phil's reaction at the end of the movie is pretty unbelievable anyway. 
Beside above, why does Phil get stuck in Groundhog Day? The second draft of Groundhog Day says, actually, it was caused by Phil's scorned ex-girlfriend Stephanie. But also in the second draft, Stephanie, Phil's ex-girlfriend, puts a curse on him. Literally, she opens a book of magic spells and does a little ritual that causes him to get stuck  
While many people have done the math on how long Bill Murray's character was trapped in the same day - various estimates range from about 500 years up to 10,000 years - the exact reason as to why  
Per IMDB, "On the DVD, Harold Ramis states that the original idea was for him to live February 2nd for about 10,000 years. Later he says that Phil probably lived the same day for about 10 years." OR "According to the website Wolf Gnards, Bill Murray spends 8 years, 8 months and 16 days trapped in Groundhog Day. 
14 days. Columbia Pictures' notes on the movie included a request that the number of days in Phil's time loop be cut way down. "According to them, Phil couldn’t be stuck in the time loop for  </p>
