Reviews Legends of Tomorrow Season 3 Episode 11 Review: Here I Go Again. Zari shines in her feature episode, the Groundhog Day themed "Here I Go Again." 
And the time loop fun begins! If you’ve seen Groundhog Day, Edge of Tomorrow, or, I don’t know, those special episodes of The X-Files or Supernatural or that Taye Diggs series Day Break  
DC’s Legends Of Tomorrow knows that it’s kind of hacky to do a Groundhog Day-inspired time loop episode, but as Nate tells Zari, it all comes down to execution.And this episode is damn good  
A trip to the 1970s goes wrong and traps the Waverider in a time loop. Tropes: Accidental Misnaming: Zari forgets the name of the film Groundhog Day and calls it Hedgehog Day. Accidental Murder: In one loop, Sara mistakes Zari and Ray for flies  
Thanks to her Groundhog Day-inspired struggle, Zari was able to come out of her shell and forge closer bonds with her teammates. That's more than worth the trade-off of not having much progress on

That's right, woodchuck chuckers, it's Groundhog Day! Now that today is February 2nd, let's take a look at the just-released synopsis for an upcoming episode of Legends of Tomorrow which will take inspiration from the classic Bill Murray comedy based around the holiday. 
As revealed when its synopsis was unveiled, fittingly, on February 2nd, an upcoming episode of Legends of Tomorrow will see the DC superhero show offer its own spin on the classic Groundhog Day  
I like SG-1, but that episode was a pretty standard Groundhog-Day plot. Plenty of amusing moments (the gate-golf, Teal'c getting hit in the face every time) but nothing remarkable.

Here I Go Again: Directed by Ben Hernandez Bray. With Brandon Routh, Caity Lotz, Maisie Richardson-Sellers, Amy Louise Pemberton. Zari finds her place on the team when she gets caught in a time loop that results in the Waverider blowing up over and over again. 
Spread the loveZari is the focus as the Legends of Tomorrow do the Groundhog Day-style episode that every CW/WB show is apparently mandated to do. Charmed pulled a Groundhog Day twice, in 1999 and 2005. This iteration did make some headway into the lives of the ensemble crew of the Waverider, leaving us with so </p>
