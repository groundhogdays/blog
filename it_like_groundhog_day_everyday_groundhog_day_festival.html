        <p>To provide a smidge more detail, the movie Groundhog Day is about a man reliving the same day over and over and over. Every time he wakes up it's Groundhog Day again, and people always say the same things and do the same things over and over, and he's the only one who is aware of the infinite repetition and who is capable of doing things differently.

Of course, there’s more to it than that but the saying ‘my life feels like groundhog day;’ comes from that film. And if you’ve ever used that phrase yourself, you’ll know exactly what I am talking about. Here are my top 3 tips on how to get yourself out of a rut and get rid of feeling like you’re experiencing Groundhog day. 1. 
No more Groundhog DayI expect greatness! There shall be no more Groundhog Days feeling trapped and feeling as though you are living the same day over and over again. No, from this moment forward, we are going to shake things up and bring great changes to our lives. These shall be positive changes, and things that we can cherish forever.

We can feel like we’re spinning our wheels. We can feel like we’re just going through the motions. We can feel like we are powerless to change our circumstances. 
The combination of boredom—from too many days that all look virtually identical—and anxiety—that’s all the anxieties: health, economic, social, political—works together to make it seem as if time is moving in slow and disorienting ways, and every day feels like the movie Groundhog Day. 
In the 1993 comedy, Groundhog Day, Bill Murray plays Phil Connors, a grouchy weatherman covering Groundhog Day in small-town Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. After getting stuck in Punxsutawney due to an unexpected snowstorm, Phil finds himself waking up on February 2—Groundhog Day—every single morning. Phil is not impressed.

Ironically written. Trent Reznor hardly lives every day the same. No one that has accumulated a net worth of about 70 million has a same day. That dude hustles and networks and creates. There's a secret in that sauce. Get up, get shit done, and stop looking for happy. Happy hides when your trying to find it. 
I was recently telling to my sister how bad of a depression rut I'm going through (again) and used Groundhog Day as a comparison. Every day is the same ,nobody knows what you're going through and it can be maddening. Not at all amusing or entertaining like Bill Murray's Groundhog Day was. 
10. Did the Groundhog catch some fog the other day? No, he mist. 11. What did Obi-Wan say to Groundhog? If every day feels like Groundhog Day, maybe it’s time to paws and reflect! 12.
