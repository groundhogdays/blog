        <h2><strong>groundhog day in other countries is groundhog day musical touring</strong></h2>
        <p>The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
Groundhog Day is a widely celebrated tradition in North America, particularly in the United States and Canada. Every year on February 2nd, people eagerly await the emergence of a groundhog from its burrow to predict the arrival of spring. However, this unique holiday is not limited to just these two countries. 
Every year, on 2 February, Punxsutawney Phil the groundhog comes out of his burrow and if the sun is shining and he sees his shadow before scurrying back into his hole, winter will last six more  
The origins of Groundhog Day can be traced back to ancient European weather lore, but the holiday has since evolved into a unique cultural celebration in North America. While Groundhog Day is primarily celebrated in North America, similar traditions can be found in other parts of the world. 
If, on the other hand, it is sunny and the groundhog sees its shadow, the groundhog will supposedly retreat into its burrow, and winter will continue for six more weeks. Candlemas is usually celebrated on the same day in Europe, and has similar weather lore about the coming weather, making it a possible origin of the holiday in North America. 
PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa. — It's almost Groundhog Day!On Feb. 2, we all look to no other than a groundhog to see if he or she sees its shadow to prognosticate what the rest of winter is going to be like. 
Other countries may have their own variations of weather-related folklore and traditions, but Groundhog Day, as it is known, is not widely celebrated beyond North America. 3. The first official Groundhog Day was in 1887 
Groundhog Day, the US tradition where the seasons are predicted by a groundhog, was made world famous by the Bill Murray film of the same name. But did you know the tradition's origins lie in Europe? 
In 1886, Groundhog Day was acknowledged for the first time in Punxsutawney by a local newspaper, Weathers Wags, according to the club.  Do other states have animals predicting the weather? 
Over time, the Groundhog Day tradition integrated with local customs, creating a unique celebration that persisted through the years. The American tradition has a big focus on Punxsutawney Phil. The event is organized by the “Groundhog Club,” who communicate with Phil in a language known as “Groundhogese” to interpret his prediction  
The Groundhog Day ceremony in Punxsutawney is conducted in Pennsylvania Dutch, a dialect of German. Groundhog Day is also celebrated in other countries, such as Germany, where it is known as "Siebenschläfertag" or "Seven Sleepers Day." In Alaska, instead of a groundhog, they use a marmot to predict the weather on February 2nd. 
There are other weather predicting animals in the country, including groundhogs Buckeye Chuck from Ohio, Staten Island Chuck in New York, General Beauregard Lee from Atlanta, Georgia and Jimmy the

The Brief. Woodstock, Illinois, became the filming location for "Groundhog Day" (1993), and the town now celebrates the movie with an annual festival that attracts visitors from around the world. 
Here's when Groundhog Day began: The first mention of Groundhog Day came in 1886 in Punxsutawney. Over the years, several other locations have begun using their own groundhog, including General Beauregard Lee of Atlanta, Dunkirk Dave of Dunkirk, New York, and Jimmy of Sun Prairie, Wisconsin.

While Punxsutawney Phil remains the star of the nation’s most famous Groundhog Day celebration, Pennsylvania Dutch Country and other parts of the state offer equally charming events to mark the day. 
So Groundhog Day is an Canadian/American holiday here’s the Wikipedia description: It derives from the Pennsylvania Dutch superstition that if a groundhog emerging from its burrow on this day sees its shadow due to clear weather, it will retreat to its den and winter will persist for six more weeks, and if it does not see its shadow because of cloudiness, spring will arrive early. </p>
