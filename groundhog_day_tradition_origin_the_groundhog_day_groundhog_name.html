        <h2><strong>groundhog day tradition origin what time does groundhog day finish</strong></h2>
        <p>The Groundhog Day celebrations of the 1880s were carried out by the Punxsutawney Elks Lodge. The lodge members were the "genesis" of the Groundhog Club formed later, which continued the Groundhog Day tradition. But the lodge started out being interested in the groundhog as a game animal for food. It had started to serve groundhog at the lodge  
The Groundhog Day tradition dates back to Germany where a badger was used to determine the coming of spring.  Uncover the history of Groundhog Day and why a groundhog predicts the end of winter  
The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The annual ritual has roots in pre-Christian traditions and was brought to the U.S. by  
Groundhog Day, in the United States and Canada, day (February 2) on which the emergence of the groundhog from its burrow is said to foretell the weather for the following six weeks. The beginning of February, which falls roughly halfway between the winter solstice and the spring equinox , has long been a significant time of the year in many  
Most of us know the tradition: on February 2, our old friend the groundhog will emerge from hibernation, come out of his den, and predict whether winter will deliver more cold weather this year. If the groundhog sees his shadow, the story goes, cold weather will persist another few weeks. If not, warm weather is around the corner. If you like the folklore of holidays, you may be interested to  
The History of Groundhog Day. The Christian religious holiday of Candlemas Day has become most commonly associated with the current celebration, but it’s roots are older than that. The celebration started in Christianity as the day, (February 2nd), when Christians would take their candles to the church to have them blessed. 
The Enduring Appeal of Groundhog Day. Despite its roots in superstition and folklore, Groundhog Day has endured as a beloved tradition for over 130 years. Its popularity speaks to the human need for levity, hope, and communal celebration, especially during the long, dark days of winter. 
In 1993, the film Groundhog Day starring Bill Murray popularised the use of the term ‘groundhog day’ to mean something that is endlessly repeated.It also popularised the event itself: after the film came out, the crowd at Gobbler’s Knob grew from around 2,000 annual attendees to a staggering 40,000, which is nearly 8 times the population of Punxsutawney. 
Across the US, the quirky tradition is known as Groundhog Day. But among its original celebrants, it has a different name:  "The origins of Groundhog Day are fascinating," says Louden. "It goes  
On February 2, 1887, Groundhog Day, featuring a rodent meteorologist, is celebrated for the first time at Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania.According to tradition, if a groundhog  
It turns out that the modern Groundhog Day tradition is a tale of adaptation, with its origin in a centuries-old Christian holiday. Candlemas, the Groundhog Day forerunner. Groundhog Day is rooted in the historical Christian tradition of Candlemas, about halfway between the winter solstice and the spring equinox. Conventionally, this was  
Tradition says that North America will get six more weeks of winter if Phil sees his shadow and an early spring if he does not.  and the rest is history. The club says Groundhog Day is the same  
Well, its origin is a lot more bizarre than you think.  While the Groundhog Day tradition as we know it today started in 1887, Phil has been making his predictions since 1886. 
An unusual, yet beloved holiday February 2nd is Groundhog Day, the day when a groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil predicts whether or not we will have six more weeks of winter. If he sees his shadow, more cold is on the way; if not, warmer weather is coming. While this holiday may seem like a silly tradition, it has a surprisingly deep history. Ancient Traditions 
In other words, the Groundhog Day tradition may have begun as a bit of folk humor. Famous prognosticators and predictions. Towns throughout North America are known to have winter-predicting groundhogs. The most famous is Punxsutawney Phil of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania (immortalized in the movie Groundhog Day). 
Attendance at the town’s annual groundhog event ballooned from 1,000 people to more than 35,000. The film also created a modern idiom—the repetition of a monotonous or unpleasant situation is said to be experiencing a Groundhog Day—even though repetition has nothing to do with the tradition of Groundhog Day other than its annual observance. 
When British and German immigrants first came to the United States, they brought their traditions with them, including the celebrations that evolved into Groundhog Day. Groundhog Day isn’t the  
Feb. 2 is also known as St. Brigid's Day, mixing figures from pagan traditions and Christian beliefs. In Europe, groundhogs weren't the animal of choice for the festival, according to the almanac. 
Groundhog Day's Lasting Impact. Groundhog Day isn't just a quirky tradition; it's a fascinating blend of history, culture, and fun. From its roots in ancient weather lore to its modern-day celebrations, this event captures the imagination of many. 
The groundhog is known as Punxsutawney Phil, because the town where the Groundhog Day tradition originated is called Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. A big celebration is still held in the town to this  </p>
