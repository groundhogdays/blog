        <h2><strong>do you go to school on groundhog day books on groundhog day</strong></h2>
        <p>The short answer is, it depends. Groundhog Day, celebrated on February 2nd, is a unique holiday that is usually not observed as a federal or state holiday. This means that schools and businesses usually operate as usual. However, some schools and institutions may choose to celebrate Groundhog Day with special activities or events. 
It’s 54 pages and perfect for ages Pre-K-2. You might plan to finish it by the 100th day and compare the character’s accomplishments to the class’s. If you prefer, read The Night Before the 100th Day of School about one boy’s struggle to find 100 of anything to bring to class for the 100th Day project. 
Groundhog Day is not one of the 11 official U.S. Holidays so school is held unless it falls on a weekend. More info on Groundhog day can be found at National Day Calendar. 
The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records.

In Nova Scotia, Groundhog Day is called Daks Day. This comes from the word “dachs” which is German for badger. While Germans don’t celebrate Groundhog Day, they do celebrate a holiday they call Dachstag on February 2. The history of Groundhog Day goes back hundreds of years to an old European tradition that involved watching for animals  
A perfect Groundhog Day activity for the pre-school or kindergarten set is to learn about shadows with some shadow drawing!

Your young learners may not know what a groundhog is, let alone why we have a day to celebrate it each year. They might not understand why thousands of people gather in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, on a cold morning every February to watch a man in a tuxedo hold a groundhog—while many more watch the ceremony live on television. 
PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa. -- Here's a look at Groundhog Day, an American tradition that is meant to predict when spring will arrive. Facts. The groundhog emerges from its burrow on February 2. If the

The Knob will be open February 1, the day BEFORE Groundhog Day, until 4:00pm. The Knob closes to vehicular and pedestrian traffic for site and festivity preparation. The Knob opens back up to vehicular traffic on February 2 nd around 10 am, after all buses have transported visitors off the Knob. 
There are some really great groundhog themed read alouds for your class to enjoy. I think my favorite is Go to Sleep Groundhog by Judy Cox. I also really love using Gail Gibbons' Groundhog Day. Since she is all about the nonfiction, her book is perfect to compare to the other books. It is also a great illustration of various text features. 
Every February 2nd is Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. Each year, one of America’s strangest traditions occurs as Punxsutawney Phil, a weather-predicting groundhog, is pulled out of his temporary burrow at Gobbler’s Knob to get his prediction of the weather for the coming weeks.
