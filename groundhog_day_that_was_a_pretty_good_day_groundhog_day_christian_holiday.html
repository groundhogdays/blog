Groundhog Day is my favorite movie. I'm 25 years old so it's barely in my demographic to like, if it all. If you haven't seen that movie it honestly is the perfect movie. It's funny, it has a cool concept, and the concept is executed well. It also has a perfect ending. Groundhog Day is the best movie to me. 
yeah, so rightfully so. the day actually originated in pennsylvania and in punxsutawney. groundhog day isn’t just one day for the city’s groundhog club. it’s marked by a multi day celebration that even includes a groundhog ball. and this year will be extra special day for phil, as it’s his first groundhog day as a father here in alabama.
