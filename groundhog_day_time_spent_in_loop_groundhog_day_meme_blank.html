        <p>So, sometime around June 2009, a post from the blog “Wolf Gnards” claimed to have identified the amount of time Bill Murray spent in Groundhog Day's time loop, arriving at the answer: eight years, eight months, and 16 days. 
Thankfully for Murray, his time on the set of Groundhog Day was much shorter than the time his character spent trapped in the movie's time-loop. Groundhog Day follows TV meteorologist Connors, who  
Around this time, people also remember the 1993 film of the same name starring Bill Murray as a cynical weatherman named Phil Connors — who becomes trapped in a time loop and is forced to keep living Feb. 2 over and over again. However, one nagging question remains: How long was Bill Murray trapped in Groundhog Day? 
14 days. Columbia Pictures' notes on the movie included a request that the number of days in Phil's time loop be cut way down. "According to them, Phil couldn’t be stuck in the time loop for  
Groundhog Day follows Bill Murray’s character, Phil Connors, a TV weatherman who becomes mysteriously trapped in a time loop during a reporting trip to Punxataney, PA, for the town’s annual  
In Groundhog Day, Bill Murray's character, Phil Connors, becomes trapped in a time loop, but the film never explicitly specifies just how many times Phil relives the same day over and over. Directed by Harold Ramis and co-written by Danny Rubin, Groundhog Day follows a cynical weatherman (Murray) who finds himself stuck in Punxsutawney  
It might be one of the most influential comedies ever made, but there’s a hidden truth about Groundhog Day which might actually make it one of the scariest horror films of all time. The 1993 film, which is set on February 2nd and based around Punxsutawney folklore, sees Bill Murray’s weatherman Phil Connors trapped in a time loop on the  
In around June 2009, a blog post from "Wolf Gnards" purported to have calculated the duration of time Bill Murray's character spent in the time loop featured in "Groundhog Day." According to their findings, Phil Connors was stuck in the loop for a period totaling eight years, eight months, and 16 days. 
Just how many days does Phil Connors spend trapped in the perpetual loop of Groundhog Day?  and alloting for the down time and misguided years he spent, it had to be more like 30 or 40 years. 
What was the duration of Phil's time in the loop? In the iconic film Groundhog Day, Phil Connors experiences a remarkable journey through time, reliving the same day over and over again. This seemingly endless cycle lasts approximately 12,400 repetitions, which translates to nearly 34 years of his life spent in this peculiar loop. 
Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years. Deezen noted that the second draft of the screenplay called for Phil to be cursed to live the time loop for 10,000 years. In the DVD commentary, Ramis estimated a real-time duration of 10 years. 
This week we’re taking a look at some games that remind me of Groundhog Day That’s to say, 1993 modern classic Groundhog Day. Some of these are a little more groundhog based, others are a little more timey-wimey and repeating. But they’re all a fun way to spend a few hours this Sunday. And then spend a few hours this Sunday. 
The episode "Groundmouse Day" has Brain repeatedly trying to take over the world by co-opting a Groundhog Day ceremony, while stuck in a time loop, in a parody of Groundhog Day. Stephen Tobolowsky, who played Ned in the film, plays the radio DJ in this episode. 
@Omegacron - I have always assumed the same thing. Everyone was stuck in the time loop, but they weren't aware of it. To them, it seemed that nothing unusual was happening (except on a specific day, perhaps - Phil gorging himself, ranting during his monologue in front of the camera, saying that he is a god, killing himself and the groundhog, etc, all would have been unusual). 
Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years.[18] Deezen noted that the second draft of the screenplay called for Phil to be cursed to live the time loop for 10,000 years.[9] In the DVD commentary, Ramis estimated a real-time duration of 10 years. 
A plot in which the character is caught in a time loop, doomed to repeat a period of time (often exactly one day) over and over, until something is corrected. Usually, only one character or group of characters realizes what's going on — everyone and everything else undergoes a complete Snap Back, and if not interfered with will do the exact same things every time, right down to dialogue  
He was able to play complex piano scores, yet his episodic memory lasted 7 to 30 seconds. In short, he was stuck in a strange and maddening time loop. In popular culture, the time loop has been used and reused with stunning frequency. 
According to this review answering such questions in the movie itself would have "ruined" it. The original script contained an explanation of the start of the time loop - a voodoo spell - but that was considered a poor idea. 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
Ten thousand hours, at 8 hours a day, 7 days a week, is roughly 3.5 years for general expertise Considering how well Phil can play the piano, he was probably learning for closer to ten years. </p>
