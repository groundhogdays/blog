Character Analysis Larry The Camera Guy. Larry's main job in this movie is to cut tension whenever possible and basically to be Phil Connor's emotional punching bag. When Phil finally dies, Larry looks at the morgue worker and says, LARRY: He was a really great guy. I really liked him a lot . in what is a super-insincere manner. 
Character Analysis. Like any character who isn't Phil or Rita, Nancy isn't that well developed in this movie.
