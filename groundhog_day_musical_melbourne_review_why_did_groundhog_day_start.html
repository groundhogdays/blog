Review by Naomi CardwellThe arrival of Groundhog Day: The Musical in Melbourne has me nervous. Tim Minchin’s epic production about a TV weatherman with a god complex has blown in on a storm of accolades by way of London and Broadway, following the runaway success of Minchin and director Matthew Warchus’ brainchild Matilda the Musical. But musicals based on films seem like a reversal of  
Groundhog Day the Musical currently playing at Melbourne’s Princess Theatre delivers an outstanding and captivating performance that leaves the audience thoroughly entertained. Tim Minchin’s musical adaptation of the beloved film seamlessly blends humor, heart, and catchy tunes to create an unforgettable experience. 
It’s Groundhog Day. . . Again! The iconic film has been transformed into a stage musical by Danny Rubin and Tim Minchin, and it’s just fantastic. Leading characters Phil Connors and Rita Hanson are in the incredibly capable hands of Andy Karl and Elise McCann respectively – two actors who shared divine chemistry on stage. 
Beginning life as a musical in 2016, at London’s Old Vic Theatre, Groundhog Day won an Olivier Award for Best New Musical, and a Critics’ Circle Theatre Award for Best Musical. 
Groundhog Day the Musical opened at London’s Old Vic Theatre in 2016 for a criminally short season given it was so incredibly well received by critics and the public alike.

Review by Suzanne Tate . Opening Night of Groundhog Day: The Musical was a highly anticipated event for me. I am a huge Tim Minchin fan and was excited to see how his satirical comedic wit and mind-blowing musical ability would transform the popular 1990s movie through the addition of his music and lyrics. 
Groundhog Day had its world premiere and enjoyed a critically acclaimed strictly limited 10 week season at The Old Vic Theatre, London, in the summer of 2016.. One of the most ambitious shows ever to have been staged at The Old Vic, previews began on the 15th July. 
The musical is based on the 1993 film Groundhog Day. [3] The film itself starred Bill Murray as Phil Connors and Andie MacDowell as Rita Hanson and was produced on a budget of $14.6 million, earning over $70 million in domestic box office receipts. [4]

Groundhog Day the Musical has ended it’s 13-week season at Melbourne’s Princess Theatre. Phil Connors, a cynical Pittsburgh TV weatherman is sent to cover the annual Groundhog Day event in the small town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania.

Imagine living your life in an endless time loop and going crazy in the process. In essence, that is what Groundhog Day: The Musical is all about. It is based on the 1993 hit movie starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell, directed by Harold Ramis. Phil Connors is an egotistical Pittsburgh TV weather presenter. He is dreading
