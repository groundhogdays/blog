To provide a smidge more detail, the movie Groundhog Day is about a man reliving the same day over and over and over. Every time he wakes up it's Groundhog Day again, and people always say the same things and do the same things over and over, and he's the only one who is aware of the infinite repetition and who is capable of doing things differently.

Put on the map by the 1993 Bill Murray film where a TV weatherman finds himself reliving the same day over and over again, forced to report on the annual celebration time and again, Groundhog Day takes place in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania every year at Gobblers Knob. 
See how the groundhog became a symbol for predicting seasonal changes in America, rooted in German folklore with a badger ‚Äî which in turn lead to Groundhog Day. 
Even those who have never seen ‚ÄúGroundhog Day‚Äù are familiar with the film‚Äôs premise. The protagonist, Bill Murray‚Äôs Phil, is stuck in a time loop, reliving the same day over and over.

The 1993 comedy movie, Groundhog Day, takes place in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, on Groundhog Day. The main character (played by Bill Murray) is forced to relive the day over and over again until he can learn to give up his selfishness and become a better person. [18] 
A drink called ‚Äògroundhog punch‚Äô was also served. This was formalised with the formation of the official Punxsutawney Groundhog Club in 1899 which, along with hosting Groundhog Day itself, continued the hunt and feast.

But over the last 10 years, the groundhog has been correct only two other times: 2020 and 2015, resulting in an accuracy rate of 30%. In fairness to Phil, climatology isn't for the faint of heart.
