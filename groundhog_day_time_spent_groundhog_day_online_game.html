        <h2><strong>groundhog day time spent animal crossing groundhog day</strong></h2>
        <p>So, sometime around June 2009, a post from the blog “Wolf Gnards” claimed to have identified the amount of time Bill Murray spent in Groundhog Day's time loop, arriving at the answer: eight years, eight months, and 16 days. 
Thankfully for Murray, his time on the set of Groundhog Day was much shorter than the time his character spent trapped in the movie's time-loop. Groundhog Day follows TV meteorologist Connors, who  
According to WhatCulture.com — which meticulously took into account the 38 days actually shown during Groundhog Day; the 414 days that were mentioned; the 11,931 days Phil spent learning things like ice sculpting, French poetry, and playing the piano; and the days he spent performing good deeds — Harold's second estimate was much closer. 
Groundhog Day follows Bill Murray’s character, Phil Connors, a TV weatherman who becomes mysteriously trapped in a time loop during a reporting trip to Punxataney, PA, for the town’s annual  
It might be one of the most influential comedies ever made, but there’s a hidden truth about Groundhog Day which might actually make it one of the scariest horror films of all time. The 1993 film, which is set on February 2nd and based around Punxsutawney folklore, sees Bill Murray’s weatherman Phil Connors trapped in a time loop on the  
In fact, the term "Groundhog Day" has become synonymous with both the phenomenon and the film trope of someone reliving the same day over and over in other movies like Groundhog Day. The film may be iconic for its brilliant utilization of the premise, but Groundhog Day's ending still leaves many questions unanswered, including the exact number  
The most false, when it comes to Groundhog Day, is the widely-reported notion that an early version of Rubin's script had Phil explicitly saying to Rita that he had been "waiting for you every day  
WhatCulture.com calculated just how long Phil Connors spent in limbo back in 2013 to mark the film's 20th anniversary. Amazingly, the time equates to repeating the same day a torturous 12,395  
In case you didn't know, February 2nd is Groundhog Day. And to celebrate the momentous American holiday that inspired the bloody brilliant Bill Murray film of the same name, as well as the movie  
Which puts us at the grand total of 3176 repeated Groundhog days, or 453 weeks, or 105 months, or 8.7 years. Precisely, 8 years, 8 months, and 16 days.So, in the end Harold Ramis was right and I wasted a Bill Murray length of my time. 
In 2014, the website WhatCulture combined various time duration assumptions and estimated that Phil spent a total of 12,395 days—just under 34 years—reliving Groundhog Day. [52] [53] Reply reply 
This week we’re taking a look at some games that remind me of Groundhog Day That’s to say, 1993 modern classic Groundhog Day. Some of these are a little more groundhog based, others are a little more timey-wimey and repeating. But they’re all a fun way to spend a few hours this Sunday. And then spend a few hours this Sunday. 
That reply of Ramis was due to an earlier analysis (linked to by DampeS8N in a comment: "How Long Does Bill Murray Spend in Groundhog Day?", Wolf Gnards) Which puts us at the grand total of 3176 repeated Groundhog days, or 453 weeks, or 105 months, or 8.7 years. Precisely, 8 years, 8 months, and 16 days. 
I’ve spent the past year immersed in the past, present and future of Milltown’s Groundhog Day, trying to understand the stunning rise and surreal fall of a holiday that means precisely nothing  
A lifetime."[48] In 2014, the website WhatCulture combined various time duration assumptions and estimated that Phil spent a total of 12,395 days—just under 34 years—reliving Groundhog Day.[49][50] 
REUTERS. Groundhog co-handler Ron Ploucha holds Punxsutawney Phil in front of a record crowd estimated at 35,000 after Phil's annual weather prediction on Gobbler's Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, on the 127th Groundhog Day, February 2, 2013. 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly.

Thanks to a small town in northern Illinois, Groundhog Day is bigger than one chubby rodent and its shadow dropping a dubious weather forecast. In Woodstock, the groundhog takes a backseat to the real cause for celebration: the 1993 Bill Murray movie that was filmed there. WNIJ’s Under Rocks team visited the famed town square with the head of the annual festival (and Groundhog Day movie  
Groundhog Day follows an unlikely protagonist, Phil (Bill Murray), a small-time weatherman who is irritably narcissistic. He is also rude, inconsiderate, and deeply cynical. He is also rude  </p>
