We've heard of Groundhog Day and Donut Day, but did you know that there is an entire day dedicated to potholes? January 15th is National Pothole Day. Everyday, many motorists have to maneuver over potholes, for fear of damaging their vehicles. So in recognition of this day, and in the hopes of raising awareness, Lee Anna 
The Groundhog Day event as we celebrate it today at Gobbler's Knob dates back to 1887.  like New York’s Pothole Pete, General Beau Lee of Atlanta, GA, Sir Walter Wally of Raleigh, NC, and  
The Adventures of Punxsutawney Phil, Wiarton Willie, and Pothole Pete February 2 brings the most-watched weather forecast of the year—and the only one led by a rodent. Legend has it that on this morning, if a groundhog can see its shadow, there will be six more weeks of winter. 
Thanks to a small town in northern Illinois, Groundhog Day is bigger than one chubby rodent and its shadow dropping a dubious weather forecast. In Woodstock, the groundhog takes a backseat to the real cause for celebration: the 1993 Bill Murray movie that was filmed there. WNIJ’s Under Rocks team visited the famed town square with the head of the annual festival (and Groundhog Day movie

Foregrounding the technological occurrences of a pothole, Philadelphia news outlets mocked the seasonal mode of other Pennsylvanian communities that celebrated spring with the old colonial tradition of Groundhog Day.

The saturation of rain and snow brought 4.39 inches of precipitation – the highest seen in the area in February since 1940. Consequently, the month spawned numerous potholes. 
Groundhog Day is on Friday, and the nation’s most well-known groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, will take a stance on the season ahead.  Pothole season underway: What are they and how can you help  
Groundhog Day is a holiday celebrated in the United States and Canada on February 2, each year. In weather lore, if a groundhog emerges from its burrow on this day and fails to see its shadow because the weather is cloudy, winter will soon end. 
Remember that pothole full of icy water Phil plunges his foot into each morning on his way to Gobbler’s Knob?  the real “Groundhog Day” house has 8 bedrooms  
Canada has the same tradition, as well. Canada's Groundhog Day observes their own predictions of an albino groundhog named Wiarton Willie. Although Punxsutawney Phil is the most famous one, some other US cities have their own special groundhogs. For example, New York City's official groundhog is called "Pothole Pete." Groundhog Day Celebrations 
The weathercaster goes to the town in Pennsylvania to a Groundhog Day celebration that happens day after day. He steps into the same pothole with icy water, has the same conversation with the same people, and celebrates the same stupid groundhog coming of the same hole. 
Ever since the making of Groundhog Day in 1992, each year Woodstock residents still get together to celebrate Groundhog Day.

Groundhog Day is a 1993 fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin, and starring Bill Murray.Known for massively popularizing the time loop trope (to the extent that it's referred to on this site as the "Groundhog Day" Loop), cementing its namesake day into the modern lexicon as a stand-in for an unpleasant, repetitive situation, and serving as a
