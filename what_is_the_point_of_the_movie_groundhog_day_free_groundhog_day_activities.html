        <h2><strong>what is the point of the movie groundhog day groundhog day movie theme</strong></h2>
        <p>Harold Ramis’ 1993 film, Groundhog Day, is a charming and heartwarming comedy about an arrogant egotistical weatherman named Phil Connors (Bill Murray) who has a change of heart over the course  
The 1993 movie is deeper than you might think.  Groundhog Day as life metaphor: Most of us have at some point been trapped in a situation where no matter what we did, we couldn’t extricate  
The plot of Groundhog Day is very much like Jewish wisdom literature, especially the Book of Ecclesiastes, alongside Egyptian texts like "The Good Fortune of the Dead" and "A Dispute Over Suicide  
This year is also the 25th anniversary of the movie "Groundhog Day." (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "GROUNDHOG DAY") MURRAY: (As Phil) A thousand people freezing their butts off, waiting to worship a rat. 
Groundhog Day (1993) Plot Summary &amp; Movie Synopsis: On February 1, PBH TV weatherman Phil Connors assures his viewers, who are situated in Pittsburgh, that they can, without any doubt, stop worrying about a blizzard that will just fall short of hitting Western Pennsylvania. 
Groundhog Day marked a transition in Bill Murray's career. In the early '90s, Bill Murray was at the beginning of the end of his "movie star" Hollywood phase, a period lasted for almost the entire 1980s; soon afterGroundhog Day, he would be making one of his first inimitable turns as a character actor, in Tim Burton's Ed Wood. 
A character introduced at point A must eventually end up at point Z, and the rest of the alphabet must be filled with traps that cause the character to evolve. The audience must ultimately acknowledge that the protagonist has been through a lot, but it was worth spending time with them. Groundhog Day is a textbook execution of this formula. 
I’ve made a point of rewatching the film on or about Groundhog Day nearly every year since the movie came out in 1993. “Groundhog Day” stars Bill Murray as a snobby urban weatherman

The film is about a TV weatherman called Phil Connor, played by Ray Murray, who, for some unexplained reason, is stuck in a time loop and wakes up every day on the same day and in the same place: 2nd of February, Groundhog Day, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The focus of the story lies in Phil’s character arc and development. 
Groundhog Day. Movie: Directed by Harold Ramis, Screenplay by Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis. Inciting Event: After covering Groundhog Day and being stuck in Punxsutawney, Phil wakes again at 6AM to his clock radio playing “I’ve Got You Babe,” the same song (a recurring motif of the film) as the previous day . He realizes it is not a radio  
“Groundhog Day” is, probably, one of the most interesting and memorable movies, starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell. It is a comedy directed by Harold Ramis in 1993. The point is that the plot of the film gets better and better each time the viewer watches it. 
The movie, as everyone knows, is about a man who finds himself living the same day over and over and over again. He is the only person in his world who knows this is happening, and after going through periods of dismay and bitterness, revolt and despair, suicidal self-destruction and cynical recklessness, he begins to do something that is alien to his nature.
