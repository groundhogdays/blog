        <p>A Must-See for 2024. For those wondering whether Groundhog Day The Musical is worth the hype, the answer is a resounding yes. Whether you’re a fan of the original movie, a lover of musical theatre, or someone simply looking for a unique and thought-provoking night out, this is one show that shouldn’t be missed. 
Afua Adjei, a vibrant and talented performer, is set to make her mark on the professional theatre stage with her debut in Groundhog Day the Musical.Based in Melbourne, Afua’s journey into the world of theatre has been marked by a deep passion for musicals and an active involvement in the city’s amateur musical theatre community. 
Review by Suzanne Tate . Opening Night of Groundhog Day: The Musical was a highly anticipated event for me. I am a huge Tim Minchin fan and was excited to see how his satirical comedic wit and mind-blowing musical ability would transform the popular 1990s movie through the addition of his music and lyrics. 
After a decade-long anticipation, Australia is set to witness the theatrical charm of Groundhog Day The Musical. Initially announced in 2014 by the multi-talented Australian comedian, musician, and actor Tim Minchin, known for his work in Upright, this musical adaptation of the Bill Murray classic has already captivated audiences in London and Broadway. 
Critically acclaimed on both the West End and Broadway, Groundhog Day revels in one man's journey of self-discovery, day after day. Inspired by the hilarious film starring Bill Murray, Groundhog Day features a book by original co-screenwriter Dan Rubin, and music and lyrics by Tony Award-winner Tim Minchin (Matilda the Musical). 
"Groundhog Day the Musical" is a theatrical adaptation of the 1993 film "Groundhog Day," featuring music and lyrics by Tim Minchin and a book by Danny Rubin. The musical made its Broadway debut in 2017. 
Theatre includes: Groundhog Day, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead (The Old Vic); A Christmas Carol (The Old Vic/Broadway/US); Spitting Image: The Musical, Mother Goose, The Miser, Upstart Crow, The Man in The White Suit, Love Story, Daddy Cool, The Girls, Onassis, An Ideal Husband (West End); Little Shop of Horrors, Hansel and Gretel (Regent’s Park Open Air); Twelfth Night, Vernon God  
Groundhog Day contains flashing lights, smoke, gun shot effects &amp; some strong language. The story ends happily but has darker phases. One musical sequence in act 2 satirically portrays the central character attempting suicide four times. 
Groundhog Day the Musical Direct from its record-breaking run-in London, Groundhog Day the Musical made its Australian Premiere at Melbourne’s Princess Theatre in January 2024. Phil Connors, a cynical Pittsburgh TV weatherman is sent to cover the annual Groundhog Day event in the small town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. 
This is the reason you should book a trip to Melbourne to see Groundhog Day, as so many did for the Harry Potter double, because it is worth the trip! Hopefully it will get an outing in Sydney &amp; Brisbane before release to non-professional companies, but only time will tell. Andy Davis. Photographer: Jeff Busby. Click here to buy tickets 
Fresh from a hugely popular run in London, Groundhog Day The Musical plays in Melbourne at the iconic Princess Theatre for an Australian-exclusive season until 20 April. To celebrate, we asked the man behind the music—Australia's very own Tim Minchin—what makes Groundhog Day The Musical’s exclusive Australian season so damn special.
