Groundhog Day: Directed by Harold Ramis. With Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliott, Stephen Tobolowsky. A narcissistic, self-centered weatherman finds himself in a time loop on Groundhog Day. 
From this, Groundhog Day was born, a film that toys with, subverts and mocks the tropes of the comedy, science fiction and romance genres before making a whole new niche of its own. Dumping the whole garbled scientific explanation of such a time loop, we are instead left to question the mechanics of the central character’s existence, though  
Time loop movies are successful in producing the effect on the audience. To be honest, it feels good to watch unlikeable characters fail in their attempts to escape. The main question remains the same: Is “Groundhog Day” a new movie genre that provides a pathway for the main character’s enlightenment?

Groundhog Day: Directed by Harold Ramis. With Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliott, Stephen Tobolowsky. A narcissistic, self-centered weatherman finds himself in a time loop on Groundhog Day. 
The original idea for Groundhog Day came to writer Danny Rubin in 1990. He had moved to Los Angeles to work as a screenwriter. While waiting in a theater for a film to start, he was reading Anne Rice's book The Vampire Lestat (1985). 
Blood Punch — Feature Film (2014): Another film in the Groundhog Day genre. Described on IMDb as a “Horror/Thriller” but it was more of a very dark comedy rom-com! The Endless — Feature Film (2017): It only just squeaks in as a Groundhog Day type film. Not because there isn’t a time loop; more likely because there isn’t just the one. 
This is one of Murray's most iconic roles. He shines in Groundhog Day, a mostly good-natured comedy that delivers lots of laughs and honest sentiment. Funny and sweet, the film has the right blend of comedy and romance. Although Phil isn't a particularly admirable character, the movie manages to make us care about him. </p>
