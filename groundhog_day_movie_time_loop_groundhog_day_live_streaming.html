        <p>Thankfully for Murray, his time on the set of Groundhog Day was much shorter than the time his character spent trapped in the movie's time-loop. Groundhog Day follows TV meteorologist Connors, who  
Time and time again I marvel at what may be the reason the loop ends and find different answers each time. To me that's the true greatness of this movie: it's like a painting that's a bit different each time you see it and while you evolve and understand the world a little different, your conclusions on this movie evolveand change with you. 
The amount of time Bill Murray remains trapped in Groundhog Day’s time loop: 33 years, 350 days. Quite a bit longer than Wolf Gnards’ prediction or Ramis’ original 10 years, but certainly better than the 10,000 years the original script called for. 
14 days. Columbia Pictures' notes on the movie included a request that the number of days in Phil's time loop be cut way down. "According to them, Phil couldn’t be stuck in the time loop for  
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
It might be one of the most influential comedies ever made, but there’s a hidden truth about Groundhog Day which might actually make it one of the scariest horror films of all time. The 1993 film, which is set on February 2nd and based around Punxsutawney folklore, sees Bill Murray’s weatherman Phil Connors trapped in a time loop on the  
In fact, the term "Groundhog Day" has become synonymous with both the phenomenon and the film trope of someone reliving the same day over and over in other movies like Groundhog Day. The film may be iconic for its brilliant utilization of the premise, but Groundhog Day 's ending still leaves many questions unanswered, including the exact number  
Responsible for popularising a unique genre, Groundhog Day stars Murray as Phil Connors – an insufferable, cynical TV weather reporter who travels to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to cover an annual spectacle. However, he finds himself trapped in a seemingly endless time loop where he is forced to live the same day over and over again. 
Here we go again: Time loop stories were around long before the 1993 movie Groundhog Day. So a friendly reminder that one person's discovery of something isn't the same as its invention. 
The movie follows the story of Phil Connors, played by Bill Murray, a cynical weatherman who finds himself trapped in a time loop, reliving the same day over and over again. As the film progresses, it raises intriguing questions about the nature of existence, personal growth, and the possibilities of breaking free from our own self-imposed

The Groundhog Day inspirations are obvious in this movie, but it feels fresh with how the time loop mechanic is used as a source of dark humor, cathartic change, and character development. Both Samberg and Milioti bring tons of fun and chemistry to their roles, making Palm Springs one of the most enjoyable in the genre. 
Groundhog Day: 1993: Self-centered television weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is forced to relive the same day over and over.

Like a man stuck in a time loop, iterating on the same day over and over again, it took Hollywood several decades after the release of "Groundhog Day" to truly perfect the time loop movie. 
The story spoofs elements of both Groundhog Day and The Hudsucker Proxy—with mouse-eared "Daddy Time" (i. e. Moses) being wise to the time loop, and a Phil-like character reliving a similar time loop in a movie on Donald's TV. 
Movies that, like Groundhog Day, have a time loop of 24 hours or less. More examples:  
"Groundhog Day" has prompted much discussion over the years, including how long Phil was stuck inside the time loop (guesses range from a few weeks to "a lifetime"), and if the movie is a
