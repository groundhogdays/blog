        <p>Action movie star Tom Cruise puts in a performance that exceeds expectation in Edge of Tomorrow, a sci-fi movie that takes the concept of Groundhog Day and runs in a totally different direction, all while playing with action movie tropes to deliver something great. 
Top 25 Groundhog’s Day Type Movies/Shows.  Director Doug Liman Stars Tom Cruise Emily Blunt. 19. For All Time. 2000 1h 24m TV-PG. 6.9 (1.1K) Rate. TV Movie. 
“Edge of Tomorrow” a.k.a. “Live. Die. Repeat.” (2014) • This is one of Tom Cruise’s most underrated roles. We watch him die on an endless loop as he tries to learn how to win in a war  
Edge of Tomorrow: Directed by Doug Liman. With Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt, Brendan Gleeson, Bill Paxton. A man fighting in a war against aliens must relive the same day every time he dies until he can find a way to stop their power source with the help of an elite soldier. 
While there have been plenty of time loop movies over the years, many have used the concept to dramatic effect, like in 12 Monkeys and Source Code.However, the classic 1990s comedy Groundhog Day helped popularize the time loop comedy subgenre in which a character is stuck reliving the same day over and over again until they figure out how to break the loop, leading to all kinds of hijinks as  
Premiering only a few months after the release of Groundhog Day, this TV movie is a feature-length version of the much darker Oscar nominee, which was titled 12:01 PM (watch it on YouTube). Both  
Emily Blunt and Tom Cruise star in 2014’s sci-fi movie Edge of Tomorrow, which takes the idea of repeated time cycles to epic new levels. Cruise’s military commander must battle invincible  
Best Tom Cruise movie in the last 20 years.  Like groundhog day, constant daily loop Palm Springs Boss Level Not constant daily loop, but still stuck in a timeloop  
“Edge of Tomorrow” a.k.a. “Live. Die. Repeat.” (2014) This is one of Tom Cruise’s late, great, underrated roles. We watch him die on an endless loop as he tries to learn how to win in a  
This Groundhog Day, be sure to have movies like 'Palm Springs' and other time travel movies queued up to celebrate the holiday.  Lt Col. Bill Cage (Tom Cruise)  Edge of Tomorrow is an  
There have been many time loop movies in the history of cinema, including beloved titles like "Palm Springs" and "Groundhog Day." But there's never been one quite like "Edge of Tomorrow," which  
IMDb, the world's most popular and authoritative source for movie, TV and celebrity content. 
Jack Reacher was pretty well recieved but it had a broader appeal since it was just another Tom Cruise action movie. Oblivion was really good but I could see how the it may not have scratched the sci-fi itch with the unoriginal story. This may have caused people to think Edge of Tomorrow was going to another generic Tom Cruise action sci-fi flick. 
“12:01” (1993) • The short story on which “12:01” is based actually pre-dates “Groundhog Day” by nearly 20 years.It’s about a man caught reliving the worst day of his life when his  
Edge Of Tomorrow, Doug Liman’s click-clacky sci-fi take on Groundhog Day, stars Tom Cruise as a smarmy press flack who get stuck in a time loop during an alien invasion.An entertaining, effects  
Here it is, the 2014 summer blockbuster to beat: Doug Liman’s Edge of Tomorrow (forgive the awful title) is a high-concept, high-powered ride through – and through, and through – a D-Day-like assault on an alien menace that has invaded Europe, with our hero (played by Tom Cruise) continually waking up on the eve of destruction every time  
Edge of Tomorrow is honestly my favorite Tom Cruise movie, and when you have such a great track record like Cruise, that's really saying something. The film is phenomenal, as with Groundhog Day it follows a similar plot, but it certainly has a different way at going at the themes it develops. 
The Tom Cruise movie Edge of Tomorrow (aka Live/Die/Repeat) borrows ideas from both Replay and Groundhog Day: Looped time period over and over Selfish protagonist that has to become selfless and serve others Emily Blunt’s character is named Rita just like Andie MacDowell’s character in Groundhog Day

Tree Glebman is Jess in this scenario, but while the latter functioned amidst a bleaker tone, the former revels in a more darkly comic and absurdist backdrop. 
Another way to describe getting trapped in a time loop is to reference "Groundhog Day," but it's not the only time-loop film worth watching.  Tom Cruise starred in an action movie variant  </p>
