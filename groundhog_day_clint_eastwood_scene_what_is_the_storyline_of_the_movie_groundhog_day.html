        <h2><strong>groundhog day clint eastwood scene groundhog day video 2025 canada</strong></h2>
        <p>Below is a clip from the movie that has one of my favorite scenes (aside from all the Ned Rierson bits).the bar Scene. The clip is the best I could find, and is a little longso (since we are a blog about Smokes and Booze) pay attention for-0:30 – Clint Eastwood Spoof (“Call me Bronco”) with a Cigarillo ; 4:18- The Bar Scene 
I watched a little Gorundhog’s Day last night. For the life of me, I can never remember him dressing up like Clint Eastwood and going to a movie with a woman. A random woman. . .not Nancy, because Nancy walks by in that scene. Tell me I’m not crazy. Has that scene always been in the movie? 
Groundhog Day (1993) - (at around 43 mins) Right after the scene where Bill Murray as Phil Connors is going to the movie theater dressed like Clint Eastwood in a spaghetti western, it cuts to the morning again and a shot of a TV monitor where Phil is once again talking on camera about the groundhog. 
If Clint Eastwood had starred in "Groundhog Day" it might have been a very different movie 
When Phil is dressed as an outlaw and pretending to be “Bronco” his Clint Eastwood impression voice is out of sync with his lips. On Day 2, Phil makes a cup of coffee before leaving the hotel. He carries it out of the hotel in his bare hand. When he comes out of the hotel he has his gloves on. Phil departs from the office right after the  
The song played in the final scene, "Almost Like Being in Love", comes from another time-bending romantic movie, Brigadoon, about a Scottish village that reappears and comes to life just one day every century. 
He’ll steal money from a bank, spend his day dressed up as Clint Eastwood, romance the town hottie or sit at the local diner and gouge down a buffet of desserts. Nothing Phil does matters. The day will end and Phil will once again wake up hearing ‘I Got You Babe’ on the clock radio. 
Groundhog Day is a classic. As one of the acknowledged. As many of you know, today is Groundhog Day.  A Compilation of Great Scenes from the Movie Groundhog Day. by Aiden Mason Published Feb 2  
The tale of jaded weatherman Phil Connors, who learns to become a better person by reliving the same day, over and over, has a 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and is one of IMDB.com's 250 top-rated  
The one in blue is holding a yellow sign upside down that says Phil (the groundhog, not the character). The first 3 days in a row they are together as they should be. On the fourth day and every day thereafter the woman in blue is by herself which does not follow the exact day sequences. (00:21:25 - 00:35:25) chiefs58 
scene from the 1993 film Groundhog Day 
In Harold Ramis's "Groundhog Day" (1993), an intriguing comedy about repeating the past, Bill Murray is Phil Connors, an arrogantly self-centered and cynical TV weatherman, sent for the fifth time to the small town of Punxsutawney, PA to cover the Groundhog ceremony held every February 2nd. 
Phil may go through the same day over and over again, but Bill Murray made each day feel different with incredible wry one-liners, hilarious scenes, and hear 
Despite the fact that the movie Groundhog Day was based on an annual event in Pennsylvania, it was not filmed there. No, virtually all of the famous scenes were captured in a real town in Illinois and you can see what they look like today. 
Kino Lorber Studio Classics and Kino Cult have unveiled the details of their November 2024 4K UHD and Blu-Ray releases including works from such icons as Billy Wilder, James Cagney, Willem Dafoe, Ashley Judd, Clint Eastwood, Shirley MacLaine, Tommy Lee Jones, and more. 
“Groundhog Day” fans can recapture the magic of Phil and Rita’s romantic snow dance in the historic square gazebo. We had fun recreating the romantic moment where Andie MacDowell and Bill Murray dance in the gazebo as seen in the beloved film “Groundhog Day.” 4. Bar Scenes (Old Courthouse and Public House of Woodstock) 
A couple of mine would have to be Michael Corleone's lighting the guy's cigarette in the Godfather and Clint Eastwood's cigarette smoking throughout the Dollars  
The “Groundhog Day” and “Lost in Translation” star has appeared in just a few independent films, such as 2024’s ensemble crime comedy “Riff Raff” and Naomi Watts-led drama “The  
The next time we see Phil, he's using his knowledge of Groundhog Day to rob a bank truck. Phil pulls up to a movie theatre in a beautiful Mercedes dressed like a character from an old Clint Eastwood movie. It looks like he has tricked his date into going to a movie with him dressed in costume. 
This location is where Phil and his girlfriend adorned costumes to attend a movie. He opted for a Clint Eastwood look, while she chose to dress as a cocktail waitress. The small movie theater typically features “Groundhog Day” around the holiday. It has since been refurbished and the oldtime ticket counter in the front has moved inside. </p>
