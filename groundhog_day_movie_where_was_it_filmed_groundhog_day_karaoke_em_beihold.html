The 1993 Bill Murray film Groundhog Day may be set in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, but it was primarily filmed in Woodstock, Illinois. The public square that hosts the “Seer of Seer  
Bill Murray’s memorably excellent 1993 comedy Groundhog Day is an evergreen classic, but it’s gained extra significance under lockdown, with the expression ‘It’s just like ‘Groundhog Day’’ repeated, well, on what seems like a daily basis.

The movie was actually filmed in Woodstock, Illinois. Though the movie premiered quite some time ago, you can still visit Woodstock and find some familiar Groundhog Day locations: most of the buildings still stand and the town proudly displays plaques highlighting where different scenes were filmed. Why was Groundhog Day filmed in Woodstock? 
Today Detective Brett Hopper will be accused of shooting state attorney Alberto Garza. He will offer his rock solid alibi. He will realize he's been framed. And he will run. Then he will wake up and start the day over again. Detective Charlie Crews was framed, convicted and cleared for a crime he

The movie, as everyone knows, is about a man who finds himself living the same day over and over and over again.
