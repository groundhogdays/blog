        <h2><strong>groundhog day alternate ending groundhog day quotes</strong></h2>
        <p>Every year, on February 2, Phil and his team have to travel to the small town of Punxsutawney and report on the annual Groundhog Day. Phill considers this reportage to be beneath him. 
Well, Groundhog Day, the award-winning 1993 film directed by Harold Ramis, captures that feeling perfectly, but it initially had a very different ending. The critically acclaimed film sees Phil Connors ( Bill Murray ) — a weatherman from Pennsylvania who gets stuck in a never-ending time loop on Groundhog Day.

Ramis’ instincts were to make Groundhog Day more accessible, and the ending he gave the movie is perfect. Rubin’s twist is like the day where Phil convinces Rita that he is repeating February  
Film classic Groundhog Day was due to have an alternative ending — and it would have been one hell of a corker. The award-winning 1993 film starring Bill Murray as Phil Connors and Andie MacDowell as Rita could have had a very exciting twist according to screenwriter Danny Rubin. 
Initially, Phil is driven insane by his curse, but eventually learns to use his time to better himself and treat everyone in Punxsutawney with kindness, finally getting Rita's (Andie MacDowell) approval and ending the never-ending Groundhog Day loop.

To me, every day of this pandemic has felt likeGroundhog Day. I get up, I write some articles, I work on my script, I wander my neighborhood, and I go to bed doing the same thing again and again and again. Still, it's hard to think about a movie as culturally significant as Groundhog Day. It created a whole genre of comedy where people relive  
I don't think Groundhog day should be mucked with. Really, sometimes you really nail something and you should leave it the fuck alone. I mean reading that article what I was thinking was, 'Well maybe the writer got the script 90% there and Ramis's instinct on his changes got it the rest of the way'. I mean, it is neat having that knowledge. 
Scenes present in the finished film happened much earlier in Rubin's script such as Phil driving over a cliff happening in the first loop. The passage of time was also more distinct; Phil would track this by reading a page of a book per day, reaching his low point when he realizes he has run out of books. The ending also featured a twist.

Groundhog Day is almost here, and animal rights organization PETA is calling for changes to the celebration once again. PETA, or “People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals,” is suggesting the town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, replace the Punxsutawney Phil groundhog tradition with a “weather reveal” vegan cake. 
Furthermore, if Phil had wanted to learn a new skill, make a pile of money by playing the day trading market, or allow himself more time to enjoy his vacation, he merely has to act selfishly for a day and the Universe permits the day to be repeated. His friends &amp; loved ones won't remember what a jerk he was for that one day. :) –

The ending also featured a twist. 
In Somewhere In Time (1980) a subtle but key clue to explaining the twist is when they talk about "Rachmaninoff’s Rhapsody" - the same song used to fulfill the twist in another non-Sci-Fi Time Travel/Love Story Groundhog Day (1993). It's the song Phil Conners learns to play on the piano. 
The entirety of Groundhog Day, the happily-ever-after ending is anticipated. But as I reached the third-last scene, I hoped for a second that the final segment of dialogue would be 'Whatever happens tomorrow or the rest of my life, right now I am happy.'

Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
See also ST:TNG “Cause &amp; Effect,” which aired the previous year and shared the same confusion about its premise. Rather, the episode seems to fall squarely into the “time loop” interpretation by stating, at the end, that their clock is 17 days out of synch with the outside world, yet this would be the case for one-way time travel, too. </p>
