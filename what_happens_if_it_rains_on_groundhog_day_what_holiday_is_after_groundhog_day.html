        <p>Feb. 2 is also known as St. Brigid's Day, mixing figures from pagan traditions and Christian beliefs. In Europe, groundhogs weren't the animal of choice for the festival, according to the almanac. 
Groundhog Day is a tradition that has taken place annually in the town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania since Feb. 2, 1987. A groundhog, also known as a woodchuck, is brought out at sunrise to make a prediction on how the remaining winter will play out. 
The groundhog is known as Punxsutawney Phil, because the town where the Groundhog Day tradition originated is called Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. A big celebration is still held in the town to this  
The National Weather Service office in Pittsburgh which predicts the forecast for Punxsutawney is calling for a chance of rain and snow on Groundhog Day. There’s a 30% chance of precipitation in  
PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa. – Sunday marks the day the U.S. turns to a groundhog to learn if winter will tighten its grip on the country or if spring will arrive soon. That’s right, it’s Groundhog Day. However, Phil’s winter prognostications have only been right about 39% of the time, according to  
If we're being honest, it even defies common sense. The legend is simple: The groundhog's shadow on Feb. 2 predicts the weather for the next six weeks, until the start of spring. 
The Punxsutawney Groundhog Club traces the tradition's roots back to Candlemas Day in Europe ― the Christian "festival of lights" that falls on Feb. 2, midway between the start and end of winter. 
Groundhog Day happens every year on February 2. It’s the day upon which, according to legend, a groundhog seeks its shadow.  But if it be dark with clouds and rain, winter is gone and will  
But that's exactly what happens on Groundhog Day every year.  Some people now believe that if it rains on St Swithin’s Day, the same will happen – 40 more days of rainfall. No precipitation  
Since the 1880s, Groundhog Day has been observed on Feb. 2. It's been a tradition to call the mini-weather forecaster Punxsutawney Phil from a stump to find out if winter is almost finished. 
We appreciate your question and concern regarding the weather on and during graduation events this weekend. Unfortunately, in the event of forecasted rain, you should expect to see a “RAIN FEE” in your student account which will be $69.420. Just for the hell of it, we included a “just for the hell of it” fee which is $56.27. 
Phil spends eight years, eight months and sixteen days stuck in groundhog day. There is one time where Phil stayed awake until six in the morning (the first night he spent with Rita) and the day reset itself anyway.

The only predictable aspect of green rain is that it will only ever occur during Summer, and will happen at least once in that season. The day before it happens, the weather report on the TV will state something about an anomalous reading without elaborating further. Ultimately, players cannot force green rain events to happen. 
But that's exactly what happens on Groundhog Day every year.  Some people now believe that if it rains on St Swithin’s Day, the same will happen – 40 more days of rainfall. No precipitation  
Usually the rain won't last the whole day. Rain will heavily disperse crowds, reduce lineups/wait times and generally make Wonderland a far more enjoyable experience. Best of all - rain creates this beautiful cooling effect that gets rid of all the humidity! 
Groundhog Day should be on everyone’s bucket list. Groundhog Day is held at Gobbler’s Knob, a field a little under two miles outside of downtown Punxsutawney, PA. The gates to the grounds open at 3am. No tickets are required as Groundhog Day is a free event. From 3am until approximately 7:20am, a party happens at Gobbler’s Knob. 
It's neve brought up in Groudhog day, but it does come up in other versions. One of two things would happen. Either there is a set time limit with a set number of hours in the loop. Or the timeline re sets when the protagonist eventually falls asleep, gets knocked out, or dies. 
Pouring concrete in the rain can compromise its strength, increasing the tendency for dusting and scaling to develop. Once the damage is done, it can be hard to rectify and will often ruin the appearance of the finished surface. Don’t let it rain on your parade. Here are some tips for preventing and troubleshooting rain-damaged concrete. 
As we delve deeper into what happens if it rains on fresh paint, we will also cover potential damage caused by rain on newly applied paints and outline steps for repainting after rain damage. Lastly, we will offer tips on preventing future damage from rain to ensure a long-lasting and beautiful result for your home’s exterior or interior  </p>
