Bill Murray 
The real question is whether each day, he made sure the man was inside, warm and fed before he died. Or did he go back to ignoring him. Or did he scoop him up and take him to the hospital and get him checked out so when, I assume his heart gives out, he has help at hand. 
In the original pitch of that movie to producers Ramis says that Phil lived the same day for 10,000 years. This kinda freaked them out. In the end they left it ambiguous saying that it was how ever long it takes to learn to play the piano.

The old homeless man is in poor health, so Phil takes him to the hospital. Unfortunately, the old man dies at the hospital, but Phil tries to save him again the next day. Does Phil manage to break the time loop? This experience humbles Phil, and the next Groundhog Day morning, he gives a heartfelt speech during his reporting, impressing Rita.

What caused the time loop of Groundhog Day (1993) is the cynicism of Phil Connors and the weather storm he wrongly predicted that trapped him and his coworkers in the town of Punxsutawney, Philadelphia. Phil Connors constantly relives the same day and experiences highs and lows while trapped in this time loop. 
Happy Groundhog Day, everybody! Punxsutawney Phil did NOT see his shadow on Tuesday, meaning we're going to have an early spring  When Phil tries to save the homeless man. 
Roger Ebert didn't initially give Groundhog Day a glowing review. Following that, Groundhog Day was hailed by spiritual leaders, and he gave a re-review in which he honestly said he needed to look a little deeper to really appreciate what the movie really was able to do.

Groundhog Day is a 1993 fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin, and starring Bill Murray.Known for massively popularizing the time loop trope (to the extent that it's referred to on this site as the "Groundhog Day" Loop), cementing its namesake day into the modern lexicon as a stand-in for an unpleasant, repetitive situation, and serving as a  
Groundhog Day might be about a single man forced to relive the same day over and over, but one sequence raises philosophical questions that go well beyond a single individual. Even though Phil Connors’ life resets every February 2 at 6:00 a.m., the movie also shows that for each Groundhog Day he experiences, the world still continues on for  
The next few shots are Phil trying to save the old man, but no matter what he does the old man dies. It's a major character development moment. He could relieve the day a million times the man is going to die each time. 
This type of moral redemption is portrayed in a most poignant way in Groundhog Day, a movie released in 1993 starring Bill Murray and produced by Harold Ramis. In Groundhog Day, the lead character Phil Connors is a television weatherman who is arrogant, nasty, and utterly self-absorbed. Connors spends February 2nd covering the Groundhog Day
