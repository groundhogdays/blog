        <p>Video above: Rare albino groundhog spotted in the Susquehanna Valley.The Groundhog Day celebration at Gobbler's Knob started in 1887. Aside from a 10-year gap, records for each prognostication  
In 2025, 138 years later, Punxsutawney Phil is making his predictions to a sold-old crowd. Who is Punxsutawney Phil? Punxsutawney Phil is the famous groundhog who predicts the weather in  
Of course, this prediction only refers to winter weather — and not the actual season — as the Spring Equinox consistently falls within the same two-day span each year. Annually, Groundhog Day  
The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
Groundhog Day, celebrated every year on February 2, is an unusual holiday that stretches back hundreds of years back to European traditions and even ancient times. How is Groundhog Day Celebrated? Groundhog Day is famously connected to weather prediction, with the most prominent tradition involving a groundhog predicting the conclusion of  
The first official Groundhog Day took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The event took up permanent residence at Gobbler’s Knob the following year. 
1993 - Columbia Pictures releases the movie, "Groundhog Day," starring Bill Murray.In the years following the release of the movie, crowds numbering as high as 30,000 have visited Gobbler's Knob  
Groundhog Day, Feb. 2, is coming up, and soon Punxsutawney Phil will tell us what to expect from the weeks to come. The holiday dates back hundreds of years, and has grown to be a widely  
Groundhog Day By Numbers. 1841 – A storekeeper named James Morris wrote and marked the date February 2 as Candlemas Day. 40,000 – The number of people who attend the Groundhog Day celebration in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. 1886 – The year the first Groundhog Day was held in Punxsutawney. 
Many people gearing up for Groundhog Day, when eyes are on Punxsutawney Phil to learn if six more weeks of winter or an early spring is on the horizon. While Groundhog Day is Feb. 2, celebrations  
When is Father's Day? When Is Mother's Day? When Is Mother's Day in UK? Holidays. Days until Christmas; Days until New Years; Days until Easter; Days until Good Friday; Days until Halloween; Days until Spring; Days until Summer; Days until Fall / Autumn; Days until Winter; Events . This Month (January 2025) Next Month (February 2025) This Year  
Later he says that Phil probably lived the same day for about 10 years. According to the website Wolf Gnards, Bill Murray spends 8 years, 8 months and 16 days trapped in Groundhog Day. The website Obsessed With Film claims he was trapped 12,403 days, just under 34 years, in order to account for becoming a master piano player, ice sculptor, etc. 
Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years. Deezen noted that the second draft of the screenplay called for Phil to be cursed to live the time loop for 10,000 years. In the DVD commentary, Ramis estimated a real-time duration of 10 years. 
Phil relives the same day approximately 12,400 times in Groundhog Day, equating to almost 34 years. Groundhog Day director Harold Ramis initially believed Phil was trapped for 10 years, but later  
Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is an arrogant Pittsburg weatherman who looks down on everyone around him and treats his coworkers poorly. His least favorite part of the year is when the network sends him to cover Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, so when he finds he's stuck in an endlessly repeating Groundhog Day, it's a living nightmare. 
Three years later, Ramis again cast Andie MacDowell in his fantastic cloning comedy Multiplicity. Groundhog Day was filmed between the winter of 1992 and the spring of 1993. The real Punxsutawney in Pennsylvania only appeared in a few shots at the beginning of the film. 
Phil relives the same day approximately 12,400 times in Groundhog Day, equating to almost 34 years. Groundhog Day director Harold Ramis initially believed Phil was trapped for 10 years, but later went back on his stance. 
I tend to lean on it being within decades rather than 10,000 years. I think Phil would've gone utterly insane in 10,000 years living the same day. Plus I think he would've had a much bigger reaction when it finally ended because it would be a massive shock to suddenly move to the next day after 10,000 years. 
The most false, when it comes to Groundhog Day, is the widely-reported notion that an early version of Rubin's script had Phil explicitly saying to Rita that he had been "waiting for you every day  
Groundhog Day was originally known as Candlemas Day and was a Christian holiday that is celebrated each year on February 2nd. The holiday originates from the 4th century when Christians would bless and distribute candles and recite a prayer, which asked God to take away the cold, winter weather and bring about an early spring. </p>
