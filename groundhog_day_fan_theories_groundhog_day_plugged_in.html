        <h2><strong>groundhog day fan theories groundhog day monologue</strong></h2>
        <p>This "Groundhog Day" Fan Theory Is So Dark, Holy Shit.  But a fan theory by Redditor SuperConductiveRabbi suggests that the whole "be a better person" thing is a ruse,  
He knows this apparently, because he's kept track of time by reading one page of a book every day. In the film, though not explicitly mentioned, I believe the timeline is shortened to around 10,000 days. My theory is that each day that Phil has been stuck in this time loop, time continues as normal for everyone else in that world. 
Here’s what you probably know about Groundhog Day. It’s a seminal early nineties comedy. It stars Bill Murray as grouchy Pittsburgh weatherman Phil Connors, reluctantly sent to cover a yearly groundhog tradition in the small town of Punxsutawney, where he finds himself doomed to repeat the same day over and over (and over) again. 
Haruhi saw a subtitled version of Groundhog Day, liked the idea of having all the time in the world to have fun, and subconsciously created a Groundhog Day loop. Phil didn't go to sleep for years It's pretty obvious he got a good night's sleep before the loop - he never seems to need to take a nap. 
In the nearly 30 years since Groundhog Day’s original release, fans have spent plenty of time and precious web bandwidth attempting to decode the alleged layers  Groundhog Day as economic theory. 
I just rewatched Groundhog Day (1993) with my wife last night. It's my favorite movie, and though I haven't watched it as much as some people , it's easily the movie I've seen the most times. This time through, I caught something real subtle that seems to be an entire hidden plot line in the film: I'm pretty sure Phil grew up in Punxsutawney  
[Groundhog Day] Ned Ryerson is the devil, and he imprisons Phil Conners in the time loop when Phil refuses to purchase Ned's insurance. The only way Phil escapes is by finally agreeing to buy it. 
While the "Groundhog Day" theory certainly has some validity, it nevertheless has its fair share of detractors. Given the ambiguous nature of the film's timeline, some fans such as u/831pm aren't  
Groundhog Day is a comedy classic and a fan theory about Bill Murray’s comedy classic has proven to be very popular on Reddit.The movie never explained why Phil Connors was trapped in a time  
The theory also comes complete with a compelling amount of evidence that may well prove that Ned Ryerson is, in fact, the Devil in the beloved Bill Murray comedy.One or two of these are fairly innocuous: the framing of the shot in which Ned torments Phil upon his first day inside the loop focuses on steam and the color red, as well as the fact that Ned himself is the one who laughs at Phil's  
49 votes, 49 comments. 2.5M subscribers in the FanTheories community. This is a place for fans of various creative works to share theories 
Re-watching Groundhog Day, something jumped out at me: on a number of occasions, Bill Murray's character dies and the movie continues instead of immediately jumping to the next day at 6:00 am. The first time is after Bill Murray drives off the cliff with the groundhog, the camera cuts to Larry and Rita for a few seconds. 
The theory makes even more sense when you consider that perhaps, like the actual Groundhog Day, the "point" of the loop is to make Ferris reconsider every aspect of his day and approach to life and actually achieve something by helping someone else (Cameron) and perfecting the romance in his life (Sloane) 
That becomes one of Groundhog Day's best running jokes as Ned pops up again and again at the same point in time, eager as a puppy and cheerfully shrugging off whatever new means Phil has devised of dismissing him. Under the new theory, however, that first step into the puddle becomes the moment the time loop starts. 
In my theory the first interaction with the alarm clock is just the start of a normal day. Had he not interacted with Ned he never would've experienced that moment with the alarm clock again. So I'm saying on the first day Ned damns Phil to continually start that day over and over, and he takes his first step into his cursed life. 
Groundhog Day never really ends, it’s a parasite that gets passed from person to person. That’s my theory. Let Me explain: There’s a theory on reddit that Phil Connors is in hell/purgatory and that Ned Ryerson is/was the devil (need link). This video covers that idea but doesn’t link the post. I remember reading it years ago here too. 
Groundhog Day is one of my family's Thanksgiving movies (along with Charlie Brown and The Wiz, for whatever reason), so I was thinking about some of the theories associated with the movie, like how he's been living the same day for thousands of years, or how the bartender is a guardian angel type and is coherent while he's reliving those days. 
[Groundhog Day] Ned Ryerson is the devil, and imprisons Phil Conners in the time loop when Phil refuses to purchase Ned's insurance. The only way Phil escapes is by finally agreeing to buy it. First and foremost: 
Basically, the assumption is that Ned has run through 500 times already when Phil starts his Groundhog Day, and Phil's day constantly overwrites Ned's 501st day. This would explain why Ned's actions are slightly different on the days that Phil acts wildly differently. 
Therefore for Groundhog Day the curse of a single repeating day symbolized the 2,922 days that Bill Clinton would be in control of the most powerful levers of power in the world. This is why the song that plays each morning is “ I got you ” And just like the other media I decoded, the film is an appeal for people to flip to 666. </p>
