        <h2><strong>groundhog day how many loops town where groundhog day was filmed</strong></h2>
        <p>The most false, when it comes to Groundhog Day, is the widely-reported notion that an early version of Rubin's script had Phil explicitly saying to Rita that he had been "waiting for you every day  
The amount of time Bill Murray remains trapped in Groundhog Day’s time loop: 33 years, 350 days. Quite a bit longer than Wolf Gnards’ prediction or Ramis’ original 10 years, but certainly better than the 10,000 years the original script called for. 
Groundhog Day follows Bill Murray’s character, Phil Connors, a TV weatherman who becomes mysteriously trapped in a time loop during a reporting trip to Punxataney, PA, for the town’s annual  
Thankfully for Murray, his time on the set of Groundhog Day was much shorter than the time his character spent trapped in the movie's time-loop. Groundhog Day follows TV meteorologist Connors, who  
In fact, the term "Groundhog Day" has become synonymous with both the phenomenon and the film trope of someone reliving the same day over and over in other movies like Groundhog Day. The film may be iconic for its brilliant utilization of the premise, but Groundhog Day 's ending still leaves many questions unanswered, including the exact number  
It might be one of the most influential comedies ever made, but there’s a hidden truth about Groundhog Day which might actually make it one of the scariest horror films of all time. The 1993 film, which is set on February 2nd and based around Punxsutawney folklore, sees Bill Murray’s weatherman Phil Connors trapped in a time loop on the  
Around this time, people also remember the 1993 film of the same name starring Bill Murray as a cynical weatherman named Phil Connors — who becomes trapped in a time loop and is forced to keep living Feb. 2 over and over again. However, one nagging question remains: How long was Bill Murray trapped in Groundhog Day? 
Just how many days does Phil Connors spend trapped in the perpetual loop of Groundhog Day? Okay, so director Harold Ramis has sort of already answered it on the DVD commentary of the film  
"According to them, Phil couldn’t be stuck in the time loop for longer than two weeks because it was just too much for the audience to handle," Danny Rubin says in How to Write Groundhog Day (a highly entertaining book on how the movie came into existence and was shepherded by many parents). This was, after all, a way less nerdy era. 
In the iconic film "Groundhog Day," Bill Murray's character finds himself trapped in a time loop, reliving the same day over and over again. According to Whatculture.com, this peculiar predicament lasted an astonishing 33 years and 350 days, resulting in a staggering total of 12,395 repetitions of February 2nd. 
The episode "Groundmouse Day" has Brain repeatedly trying to take over the world by co-opting a Groundhog Day ceremony, while stuck in a time loop, in a parody of Groundhog Day. Stephen Tobolowsky, who played Ned in the film, plays the radio DJ in this episode. 
According to this review answering such questions in the movie itself would have "ruined" it. The original script contained an explanation of the start of the time loop - a voodoo spell - but that was considered a poor idea. 
Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years. Deezen noted that the second draft of the screenplay called for Phil to be cursed to live the time loop for 10,000 years. In the DVD commentary, Ramis estimated a real-time duration of 10 years. 
Today is Groundhog Day, which naturally leads film fans to thoughts of the classic 1993 comedy from Harold Ramis, starring Bill Murray in one of his most effective comic performances. (One which  
Initially, Phil is driven insane by his curse, but eventually learns to use his time to better himself and treat everyone in Punxsutawney with kindness, finally getting Rita's (Andie MacDowell) approval and ending the never-ending Groundhog Day loop.

I've wanted to run a time loop game ever since I heard the Adventure Zone arc the 11th Hour. I just recently ran my first game of what I think is the perfect rule set and setting for, Tales from the Loop. The game will almost certainly be set in books main setting, the Malaren islands in Sweden in the 80's, and will probably revolve around a small town the players can't leave (either because  
The premise of Groundhog Day (the movie) is brilliantly simple. Bill Murray plays weatherman Phil Connors, a sarcastic, egotistical narcissist who gets stuck in a time loop and is forced to relive  
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
You might think Harold Ramis’ 1993 American fantasy comedy film was the first occurrence of the Groundhog Day time loop. You may think Hollywood got it right, and love is the answer. Believe this at your own peril. The history of time loops
