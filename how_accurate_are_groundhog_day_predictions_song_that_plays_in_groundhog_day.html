        <h2><strong>how accurate are groundhog day predictions do they use the same groundhog every year for groundhog day</strong></h2>
        <p>As for 2025, the National Weather Service's Climate Prediction center is forecasting above average temperatures across the southern part of the country in the week after Groundhog Day, while average and slightly colder than average temperatures will stick around for the northern tier. February is also bringing a weather pattern change. 
This year, NOAA took a deeper dive into Groundhog Day results and graded the work of 19 groundhogs and groundhog surrogates to determine the accuracy of their predictions. Spoiler: Phil came in  
NOAA released a study of Groundhog Day predictions and found Punxsutawney Phil to be the 17th most accurate groundhog in the United States.  The most accurate weather predictor of the bunch was  
*Note that some groundhogs did not make predictions every year in the past 20 years. Special Mention: Punxsatawney Phil. Although he is not the most accurate seasonal prognosticator, we would be remiss not to honor the longest-running weather-forecasting groundhog in the United States, Punxsutawney Phil. 
yeah, so rightfully so. the day actually originated in pennsylvania and in punxsutawney. groundhog day isn’t just one day for the city’s groundhog club. it’s marked by a multi day celebration that even includes a groundhog ball. and this year will be extra special day for phil, as it’s his first groundhog day as a father here in alabama. 
Phil's accuracy was just 35% f rom 2005 to 2024, according to data compiled by NOAA. However, last year's declaration of an early spring was a pretty accurate prediction. 
Each Groundhog Day, Punxsutawney Phil makes his prediction about a late end to winter weather or early start to spring temperatures. Here&amp;#039;s how accurate his forecasts have been over the years. 
"It's extremely difficult to give an estimate of how accurate climate predictions are," Unger told Live Science in 2011. "But compared to the terms with which Groundhog Day predictions are made  
There are 10 years—including a stretch from 1891 to 1897—within this long history when no prediction was recorded. With so few early-spring predictions, that makes 2024 a rarity for Groundhog Day. 
Every Feb. 2, the world's most famous groundhog Punxsutawney Phil rises from its burrow in Pennsylvania for Groundhog Day to give the prediction on what type of weather the U.S. could expect to  
Groundhog Day is almost here: What to know about the rodent, the shadow, and the weather Punxsutawney Phil is the most famous weather-predicting rodent, but he apparently isn't the most accurate. 
His Groundhog Day predictions aren't great, data shows. The famed Punxsutawney Phil gives us his winter weather prediction every Groundhog Day, but historically, the results aren't all that reliable. 
Every Feb. 2, the most famous groundhog in the world has his moment in the spotlight. Punxsutawney Phil has been predicting the weather at Gobbler's Knob in western Pennsylvania since 1887. 
Groundhog Day is this weekend so let’s review how accurate the groundhog is! 
Which groundhog is more accurate? By the numbers: According to a 2022 study by FiveThirtyEight.com , Beau boasts a 63% accuracy rate for predictions from 2012 to 2021, outshining Phil’s 45.5%. 
*Note that some groundhogs did not make predictions every year in the past 20 years. Special Mention: Punxsatawney Phil. Although he is not the most accurate seasonal prognosticator, we would be remiss not to honor the longest-running weather-forecasting groundhog in the United States, Punxsutawney Phil.

As we approach Groundhog Day on Feb. 2, everyone is eager to know if we can expect spring weather sooner rather than later. Legend has it that if Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow, we’re in for  </p>
