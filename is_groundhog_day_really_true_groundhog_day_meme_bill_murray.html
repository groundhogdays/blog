        <p>The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
Records kept by the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club show Phil has predicted 108 continued winters and only 20 early springs as of 2024. According to the Stormfax Almanac, that works out to a 39%  
Uncover the history of Groundhog Day and why a groundhog predicts the end of winter in 
Each Groundhog Day, Punxsutawney Phil makes his prediction about a late end to winter weather or early start to spring temperatures. Here&amp;#039;s how accurate his forecasts have been over the years. 
The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The annual ritual has roots in pre-Christian traditions and was brought to the U.S. by  
The Groundhog Day tradition came to North America from German settlers in Pennsylvania. The celebration dates back to Candlemas Day , a Christian holiday observed on February 2nd. 
It’s too soon to tell if his 2024 early-spring prediction will come true.  Phil’s accuracy issues don’t detract from what Groundhog Day is really about. It’s a massive festival event in  
Every year on February 2, crowds gather at Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to watch a groundhog emerge for the day—just like in the classic Bill Murray film Groundhog Day. You  
As stated, Groundhog Day has been a holiday in America for over a century, the first held in 1887 in Punxsutawney. But interestingly, the history of the practice goes back even further. The furthest history tells of the practice comes from the Christian holiday known as Candlemas Day, stated by the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club. 
Where did Groundhog Day come from? The story is a weird one, involving a Roman hedgehog, a Celtic witch, and a bunch of candles.  The true story behind Groundhog Day. Written by Kristine  
Eric Von Detton, a moody teenager, is stuck in a loop where every day is December 25th, until he learns the true meaning of Christmas. Well, not the true meaning. But he does get a bit less moody in the end. 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
His Groundhog Day predictions aren't great, data shows. Groundhogs are 'true hibernators' – unlike those bear imposters While hibernation is common among many animals, groundhogs enter a level  
Groundhog Day is there primarily to entertain, but there are lots of really intelligent ideas in it. It makes me think of Deleuze and his thoughts on how change can arise from repetition. The film follows that to the letter.  
It’s too soon to tell if his 2024 early-spring prediction will come true.  Phil’s accuracy issues don’t detract from what Groundhog Day is really about. It’s a massive festival event in  
I have always been completely fascinated by the movie Groundhog Day and the potential of it having a deeper storyline than we were actually given. If you look into it's original script, you find a bit darker of a story with Phil being trapped in the time loop for around 30,000 years.

It’s not a copy, someone from Netflix screwed up. Netflix thought that NowThis created Groundhog Day for Black Man when really NowThis was just sharing Cynthia’s film. It’s also possible that NowThis screwed up by not remembering that this was Cynthia’s work and represented themselves to Netflix as the creators. </p>
