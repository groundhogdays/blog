It’s not so much about a rodent popping up and checking the weather, but that a fairly popular movie, “Groundhog Day,” gets remembered and, in some cases, rescreened. And with that movie comes the character Ned Ryerson, possibly one of the worst depictions of an insurance agent  ever. Sure, there are others with a darker tone. 
Stephen Harold Tobolowsky (born May 30, 1951) is an American character actor and writer. He is known for film roles such as insurance agent Ned Ryerson in Groundhog Day [1] and amnesiac Sammy Jankis in Memento, as well as such television characters as Commissioner Hugo Jarry in Deadwood, Bob Bishop in Heroes, Sandy Ryerson in Glee, Stu Beggs in Californication and White Famous, "Action" Jack

Groundhog Day is a beloved comedy film that has stood the test of time, and one of the standout characters is Ned Ryerson. Played by Stephen Tobolowsky, Ned Ryerson is a quirky and persistent insurance salesman who is always trying to sell policies to the film’s protagonist, Phil Connors. 
It's that time of year, so if you haven’t seen the movie Groundhog Day, rent it! Not only is it funny with a good moral lesson, but it has a pretty famous insurance salesperson as a reoccurring character, his name is Ned Ryerson. Although Ned comes off as a pushy salesperson, if you pay

The "first step" Ned refers to literally the first step Phil takes after being placed into the time loop, and Ned is laughing at the irony that Phil's first step was so unpleasant.
