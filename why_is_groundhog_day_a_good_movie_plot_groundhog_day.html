        <h2><strong>why is groundhog day a good movie groundhog day i celebrate privately</strong></h2>
        <p>Fortunately, Groundhog Day is a great movie, and Murry’s presence makes it even better. Murray has a particular gift of being able to play likable jerks, and at the beginning of this movie, Phil  
I think “Groundhog Day” is the best movie ever made. The story of a cursed man gaining redemption is my favorite.The 1993 film starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell is like classic literature. 
The plot of Groundhog Day is very much like Jewish wisdom literature, especially the Book of Ecclesiastes, alongside Egyptian texts like "The Good Fortune of the Dead" and "A Dispute Over Suicide  
Groundhog Day marked a transition in Bill Murray's career. In the early '90s, Bill Murray was at the beginning of the end of his "movie star" Hollywood phase, a period lasted for almost the entire 1980s; soon afterGroundhog Day, he would be making one of his first inimitable turns as a character actor, in Tim Burton's Ed Wood. 
Harold Ramis’ 1993 film, Groundhog Day,  One of the most remarkable things about the movie is that it is a comedy where the plot doesn’t revolve around a lot of slapstick or visual gags  
107 votes, 40 comments. true. It’s my favorite movie of all time. It really explores character development in an interesting way, where the protagonist changes but the world stays the same. 
The movie, as everyone knows, is about a man who finds himself living the same day over and over and over again. He is the only person in his world who knows this is happening, and after going through periods of dismay and bitterness, revolt and despair, suicidal self-destruction and cynical recklessness, he begins to do something that is alien to his nature. 
“Groundhog Day” was directed and cowritten by Harold Ramis, Murray’s fellow Ghostbuster and a partner from their Second City days. The film is lovable and sweet. The film is lovable and sweet. If “Scrooged” seemed to reflect a dour discontent, this one is more optimistic about the human race, and the Murray character is likable by the  
Bill Murray stars in “Groundhog Day,” a romantic comedy about a self-centered television weatherman who has only one day to live — over and over and over again. (Columbia Pictures) 
The overall performance is so good you often forget it is a movie. I have to praise the whole cast for their great performance. The movie town of Punxsutawney is actually Woodstock in Illinois who is famous for this. It is a beautiful smaller city that gave a remarkable location for the movie with a lot of charm. I have also to praise the music. 
Groundhog Day celebrations went from seeing about 5,000 spectators every year to somewhere around 35,000. “I would say it was the catalyst that put Punxsutawney Phil from having 5,000 people come for Groundhog Day to having 35,000 people come for Groundhog Day. That was the impact that the movie had.“ 
Murray had creative differences with the director. First and foremost, Murray had the idea that Groundhog Day should be more of a thinker piece—the type of movie that makes you question life and  
The plot of Groundhog Day is very much like Jewish wisdom literature, especially the Book of Ecclesiastes, alongside Egyptian texts like "The Good Fortune of the Dead" and "A Dispute Over Suicide  
This is one of Murray's most iconic roles. He shines in Groundhog Day, a mostly good-natured comedy that delivers lots of laughs and honest sentiment.Funny and sweet, the film has the right blend of comedy and romance. 
The goal of /r/Movies is to provide an inclusive place for discussions and news about films with major releases. Submissions should be for the purpose of informing or initiating a discussion, not just to entertain readers. 
If you’re looking for something a little different to break the monotony of the winter season, here are some fun and unique ways to celebrate Groundhog Day. 1. Watch Groundhog Day—and Live It Like Bill Murray! Let’s be honest: Groundhog Day (the movie) is as synonymous with the holiday as the actual groundhog. Bill Murray’s comedic  
The movie, as everyone knows, is about a man who finds himself living the same day over and over and over again. He is the only person in his world who knows this is happening, and after going through periods of dismay and bitterness, revolt and despair, suicidal self-destruction and cynical recklessness, he begins to do something that is alien to his nature. 
With Murray, he made a movie that reflected not just their genius as entertainers and comic minds but also their journey as spiritual seekers, men whose work regularly addressed the big issues in life. Except for Garfield: The Movie. That was just crap. Every re-watch of Groundhog Day reveals new layers of complexity. The film soars as a  
I've never been a Bill Murray fan (except when he was on SNL), but Groundhog Day is such a good movie! I'm going to try and talk my father into watching it with me tonight because it's something I do every February 2nd and he likes comedies, hasn't seen this one yet, hope he enjoys it! 
Why you'll like this movie: Happy Death Day cleverly combines horror, humor, and a time loop premise, creating a unique and thrilling counterpart to Groundhog Day. The protagonist's quest to solve her own murder within a repeating day mirrors Phil Connors' journey of self-improvement, balancing suspenseful mystery with comedic elements. Premise: </p>
