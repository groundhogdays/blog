        <p>Over the course of the years, Phil has had numerous noteworthy highlights: In the Fall of 2017, The Punxsutawney Groundhog Club initiated a capital campaign called Destination: Gobbler’s Knob, that’s primary focus being a visitor center at Gobbler’s Knob. 
The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
Groundhog Day has been celebrated in the United States since at least February 2, 1886. Starting in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, with its now-famous groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, the tradition spread throughout America. It is now celebrated all over, and not just with groundhogs. 
See how the groundhog became a symbol for predicting seasonal changes in America, rooted in German folklore with a badger — which in turn lead to Groundhog Day. 
The movie‘s popularity had a significant impact on the real-life Groundhog Day celebration in Punxsutawney. Attendance at the event soared in the years following the film‘s release, with crowds growing from around 2,000 in the early 1990s to over 40,000 in recent years. The Enduring Appeal of Groundhog Day 
Updated February 2, 2024 at 8:19 AM ET. On Friday morning, thousands of early risers either tuned in or bundled up to watch Punxsutawney Phil emerge from a tree stump and predict the weather. 
The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The annual ritual has roots in pre-Christian traditions and was brought to the U.S. by  
Groundhog Day, in the United States and Canada, day (February 2) on which the emergence of the groundhog from its burrow is said to foretell the weather for the following six weeks. The beginning of February, which falls roughly halfway between the winter solstice and the spring equinox , has long been a significant time of the year in many  
In Punxsutawney, 1886 marked the first time that Groundhog Day appeared in the local newspaper. The following year brought the first official trek to Gobbler’s Knob. Each year since then has seen a steady increase in participation of the celebration from people all over the world. 
Each year since then has seen a steady increase in celebration participation by people all over the world. Groundhog Day's origins lie in an ancient European celebration of Candlemas, a point  
Here's when Groundhog Day began: The first mention of Groundhog Day came in 1886 in Punxsutawney. Over the years, several other locations have begun using their own groundhog, including General  
Punxsutawney Phil was right just 30% of the time over last 10 years. In determining the accuracy of Punxsutawney Phil, NOAA compared national temperatures in the six weeks after Feb. 2 over the last 10 years. According to the data, Phil got it right last year in 2024, calling for an early spring. 
Put on the map by the 1993 Bill Murray film where a TV weatherman finds himself reliving the same day over and over again, forced to report on the annual celebration time and again, Groundhog Day takes place in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania every year at Gobblers Knob.

Over the years, Phil has predicted six more weeks of winter much more often than an early spring.  The Groundhog Day celebration at Gobbler's Knob started in 1887. Aside from a 10-year gap  
An estimated crowd of over 40,000 watches Punxsutawney Phil after he did not see his shadow predicting an early Spring during the 138th annual Groundhog Day festivities on Friday February 2, 2024  
While the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club says Phil is correct 100% of the time, according to the StormFax Weather Almanac, Phil has an overall accuracy rate of 39% over 135 years. 
According to Groundhog Club members, there has only been one Phil and he has been predicting since 1887, making him 135 years old. His longevity is credited to drinking “the elixir of life,” a  
Every February 2, on Groundhog Day, Willie takes part in the local Wiarton Willie Festival. His role is to predict whether there will be an early spring. Although the original Wiarton Willie died in 1999, the Wiarton groundhog day celebrations continue each year with the original Willie's successors, referred to as "Wee Willie." </p>
