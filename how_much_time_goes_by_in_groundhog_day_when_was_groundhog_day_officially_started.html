Here is what you need to know about Groundhog Day: the day dedicated to a weather-predicting rodent.  In 1886, Groundhog Day was acknowledged for the first time in Punxsutawney by a local  
PUNXSUTAWNEY, Penn. - Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania is the Mecca for those around the country celebrating Groundhog Day. Every year, on Feb. 2, tens of thousands of people flock to this small town of less than 6,000 people some 80 miles northeast of Pittsburgh, to see whether the town's rodent  
1993 - Columbia Pictures releases the movie, "Groundhog Day," starring Bill Murray.In the years following the release of the movie, crowds numbering as high as 30,000 have visited Gobbler's Knob  
Groundhog Day, in the United States and Canada, day (February 2) on which the emergence of the groundhog from its burrow is said to foretell the weather for the following six weeks. The beginning of February, which falls roughly halfway between the winter solstice and the spring equinox , has long been a significant time of the year in many  
In modern times, the year’s four cross-quarter days are Groundhog Day (February 2), May Day (May 1), Lammas (August 1) and – the most sinister cross-quarter day because it comes at a dark time  
Groundhog Day, Feb. 2, is coming up, and soon Punxsutawney Phil will tell us what to expect from the weeks to come. The holiday dates back hundreds of years, and has grown to be a widely  
The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
Why is Groundhog Day celebrated on Feb. 2? The origins of Groundhog Day date back to German settlers in the 1800s and the celebration of the Christian festival of Candlemas, held on Feb. 2. 
Will the Groundhog See His Shadow in 2025? According to our weather predictions, February 2, 2025, will bring snow showers and cold weather.

In 2014, the website WhatCulture combined various time duration assumptions and estimated that Phil spent a total of 12,395 days—just under 34 years—reliving Groundhog Day So it's safe to say the entire timeloop will never be confirmed, but it's somewhere between 10 and 100 years, up to 10,000. 
So, sometime around June 2009, a post from the blog “Wolf Gnards” claimed to have identified the amount of time Bill Murray spent in Groundhog Day's time loop, arriving at the answer: eight years, eight months, and 16 days.

About 25% to 55% of the average season's snow falls after Groundhog Day in the Northeast, Midwest, West and Alaska: Seventeen of the 25 cities we examined still picked up another foot or more of

When he isn't predicting the weather, he is at home, with his wife, Phyliss. While the Groundhog Day tradition as we know it today started in 1887, Phil has been making his predictions since 1886. 
The time phil, turns of, his alarm in the movie.  just before he goes, to sleep, at the end of, the second day? He places a broken pencil, by his alarm clock  
Ten thousand hours, at 8 hours a day, 7 days a week, is roughly 3.5 years for general expertise Considering how well Phil can play the piano, he was probably learning for closer to ten years.
