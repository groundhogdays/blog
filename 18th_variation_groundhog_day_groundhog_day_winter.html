        <h2><strong>18th variation groundhog day is groundhog day on hulu</strong></h2>
        <p>Hope you enjoy.This piece is featured in the movie "Groundhog Day", where Bill Murray plays a jazz version. That clip can be found here: 
The 18th variation, by far the most popular, has been used in various movie and TV show soundtracks to different degrees. This includes: The Story of Three Loves (1953) Somewhere in Time (1980 film) Singapore Sling (1990 film) Dead Again (1991) Groundhog Day (1993 film) Ronin (1998 film) The Byron Janis Story (2010 TV movie documentary) 
Rachmaninoff’s “Rhapsody” features 24 variations, but the one that Phil learns is the one that has crossed over into pop culture time and time again. It’s the 18th variation, which has been used in films like Somewhere In Time, TV series like The Good Wife, and even video games like Gran Turismo 6. 
Variation 11 transitions to the slow “second movement” (variations 12-18). In keeping with the middle movement of a concerto, the harmony shifts from A minor and wanders through several other keys until it arrives at the famous 18th variation in D-flat major, which was featured in the 1993 hit movie Groundhog Day. “This one

And the variation’s association with the film can help explain its prominence on the ice from 1986 forward as well as its pivotal role in Groundhog Day, Sparky’s Magic Piano, and other post-1980 films and television shows that employ the variation. 26 
See how the groundhog became a symbol for predicting seasonal changes in America, rooted in German folklore with a badger — which in turn lead to Groundhog Day. 
This is the 18th variation, which is the most well known of the 24 and has been featured in many films, including “Somewhere in Time” and “Groundhog Day.” While Paganini’s theme is in minor, the 18th variation is based on an inversion of the theme and is in a major key.

Harold Ramis, the director and co-writer of Groundhog Day, might have chosen any piece from the piano repertoire. (It’s Mozart’s Sonata No. 16 that Phil hears on the radio, inspiring him to take piano lessons.) But he goes with Rachmaninoff’s 18th variation. Why?
