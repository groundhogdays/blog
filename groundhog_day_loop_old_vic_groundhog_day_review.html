(Admittedly, chaos theory suggests that with a system as complex as Earth the characters doing things slightly differently, even if the overall action is the same, could end up with a completely  
A plot in which the character is caught in a time loop, doomed to repeat a period of time (often exactly one day) over and over, until something is corrected.
