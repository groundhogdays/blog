        <p>The ‘Groundhog Festival Banquet’, where Connors puts his new musical skills to good use, is held at Woodstock Moose Lodge, 406 Clay Street, at Newell Street. ‘Gobbler’s Knob’ is never really explained in the film, since the festival takes place in the town’s square. 
The Groundhog Day Ceremony was recorded on Woodstock Town Square, near the gazebo. The Northen Federal Savings Bank is the Chase Bank at 118 Cass Street. Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, is a real-life town, hosting the annual Groundhog Day since the 1800s. The event is attended every year by thousands of visitors from around the world. 
Groundhog Day Locations. This 1993 comedy film is set in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, a borough in Jefferson County. But none of the scenes from the movie were filmed there. Instead, the Groundhog Day production took place in different locations around Woodstock, Illinois, approximately 61 miles northwest of Chicago. 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
Phil Connors, a TV weatherman is caught in a time loop living the same day over and over again. The film was released on February 12, 1993, grossed $70.9 million worldwide, won the 1994 BAFTA Film Award for Best Original Screenplay and was selected for the United States National Film Registry. Groundhog Day is listed as one of the best comedy  
The Brief. Woodstock, Illinois, became the filming location for "Groundhog Day" (1993), and the town now celebrates the movie with an annual festival that attracts visitors from around the world. 
‘Groundhog Day’ was filmed in Illinois, California, and Pennsylvania, specifically in Woodstock, Algonquin, Rockford, Waukegan, Cary, Loves Park, Los Angeles County, Pittsburgh, and Blairsville. As per reports, the principal photography for the Bill Murray starrer commenced in mid-March 1992 and wrapped up after around 86 days or so, in  
That particular day is 2 February, otherwise known as Groundhog Day, when the American tradition of a groundhog predicting the start of spring takes place. Connors’ day begins with his clock-radio alarm playing Sonny and Cher’s ‘I Got You Babe’ and continues through a series of repeated encounters he gradually learns to side-step and  
Although Groundhog Day takes place in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, they didn’t film the movie there. Instead, production took place mostly in Woodstock, Illinois, according to Penn Live . 
The 2025 schedule begins Jan. 30 and includes groundhog trivia, a Groundhog Day 5K, a showing of the film, a walking tour of the filming sites, a meet-and-greet with Stephen Tobolowski and more. 
Groundhog Day is here which means it’s time to watch the 1993 movie Groundhog Day instead of the news that we’re getting 6 more weeks of winter. Bill Murray’s time loop comedy will make you feel better about being stuck in the same day for the past year. This is the most topical movie of the COVID era. 
PUNXSUTAWNEY, PA - FEBRUARY 02: Groundhog Punxsutawney Phil climbs on the top hat of his handler after Phil did not see his shadow and predicting an early spring during the 127th Groundhog Day  
This is where the events of the movie "Groundhog Day" take place, where Phil finds himself stuck in a time loop reliving the same day over and over again. The town of Pittsburgh serves as the setting for the film's storyline and is where Phil experiences his repeated days until he learns the lessons needed to break free from the cycle. 
As successful as those movies are, they all owe a lot to the original time-loop gem, Groundhog Day. The comedy stars Bill Murray as a cranky weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day festival but finds himself waking up on the same day over and over.

What a nice post to read today. Every time it’s groundhog day, this movie always comes to mind. It’s such a funny comedy and I can’t get enough of it. Especially because of Bill Murray. He’s such a funny actor. Thanks for letting us take a peek inside the actual house. It’s such a beautiful place, but I prefer the movie sets. 
Under this theory, if German settlement had been centered further north, Groundhog Day would take place at a later date. [124] However, the observed behavior of groundhogs in central New Jersey was that they mostly come out of their burrows in mid-March, regardless of Groundhog Day weather. [125] </p>
