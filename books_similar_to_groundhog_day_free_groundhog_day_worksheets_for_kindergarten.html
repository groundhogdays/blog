        <h2><strong>books similar to groundhog day groundhog dies on groundhog day</strong></h2>
        <p>A murder mystery novel inspired by Agatha Christie with a dash of Groundhog Day and a hint of Quantum Leap and Downton Abbey. If that doesn’t make you want to read The 7½ Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle by Stuart Turton, then maybe this will. 
Just in time for Groundhog’s Day (the holiday), we have a list of great time loop novels like Groundhog’s Day (the movie)! Just kidding! If you’re familiar with the 1993 film, you know that reporter Bill Murray gets stuck in a small town covering the news about Punxsutawney Phil, the groundhog who may or may not see his shadow. 
Groundhog Day, Happy Death Day, and Palm Springs are just a few examples of this trope. TV is no different, with Supernatural, Russian Doll, and other shows devoting an episode or an entire series to the concept of repeating a day. You know how it goes: a character wakes up, usually to a radio playing a song or the ring of a phone. 
What is a time loop book? Think of it as a story that repeats itself over and over, much like the famed movie, Groundhog Day. It can also be a book that starts and finishes on the same day without necessarily doing multiple repeats. These stories can be loads of fun or utterly flop. The trick is in the scenarios the writer is conveying. 
Ryan Gilbey Groundhog Day Similar books. Readers who enjoyed Groundhog Day (BFI Modern Classics) by Ryan Gilbey. 4.07 avg. rating · 111 Ratings. 
If you’re looking for book recommendations similar to Groundhog Day, check out these four books with time loops that are as frustratingly enjoyable as the classic. 1. Before I Fall by Lauren Oliver 
It's been years since I read this book. It was interesting but I thought it was a bit odd. I read book 2 Hollow City as well, but I haven't kept up with the series. I don't remember a lot about the book, but the children at Miss Peregrine's home are reliving a day during WWII. This has allowed them to live a long life, except they never grow up. 
2. "4 3 2 1" by Paul Auster. 4 3 2 1 tells the stories of young Archie Ferguson growing up in the 1950s and ’60s. Notice the plural stories: the entire book hinges on a ‘what if’ moment, where the plot splits into four possible lives Archie might go on to live. 
Quote from wikipedia "Harold Ramis, who directed Groundhog Day, found the meaning of Strange Life of Ivan Osokin similar to the existential dilemma of Groundhog Day. Both works imply that a sober acceptance of personal accountability is necessary in order to effect an increase in the degree of freedom of the individual. 
Find books like Groundhog Day! (New &amp; Updated) from the world’s largest community of readers. Goodreads members who liked Groundhog Day! (New &amp; Updated)  
Sweet, watercolor illustrations on a white background add to the book’s clean, simple nature. The text has some repetition among the words, but the inclusion of a few contractions may make it difficult for some readers. New readers in grades K-2, especially animal lovers, will enjoy learning about Groundhog Day from this short informational book. 
Groundhog Day Animation created for the observance of Groundhog Day for the Air Force Reserve, at Robins Air Force Base, Georgia, January 28, 2025.  MORE LIKE THIS. CONTROLLED VOCABULARY  
Substitute Groundhog. Groundhog’s Dilemma. Celebrating Groundhog Day: History, Traditions, and Activities – A Holiday Book for Kids (Holiday Books for Kids) Groundhug Day. Grumpy Groundhog. Groundhog Gets a Say 
Oh, I enjoyed the movie, but a lot of the book covered the internal thought process which were in the book was not carried over in the movie. Most of the movie was decent, but I really wish they did not go with the happily ever after ending. I won't ruin it, for those who have not read it, but the ending was very powerful in the book.

I really love the philosophical simplicity of the plot and the the way it made me want to ensure that every day is not exactly the same, basically to avoid living in my own personal Groundhog Day. I essentially want to find a book that will present a at least somewhat similar scenario with perhaps some comedic elements that will help me get off  
Groundhog’s Day Off. Groundhog’s Day Off by Robb Pearlman has a similar plot to Substitute Groundhog and would be great to compare and contrast.. In this hilarious picture book, Groundhog is a little burnt out on making weather predictions. 
I love this trope so much. Even when the writing is poor or the plot doesn’t make much sense, I always enjoy the book or movie. I have found a bunch of movies that have this plot (Groundhog Day, Palm Springs, The Map of Tiny Perfect Things, ARQ, The Edge of Tomorrow, etc.) but I have had a bit harder time with books. 
Well, it's not a concept "like" Groundhog Day, it's a concept exactly the same as Groundhog Day. Reply reply  Books like the movie Coherence (2013) 
In this humorous Groundhog's Day picture book by the #1 New York Times bestselling author of The A Day at Dunder Mifflin Elementary, it's the day before the big event . . . and the Groundhog goes on st More </p>
