        <p>“When our day is exactly like the last, and we are feeling stress about sickness, economic struggles, and the state of the world and our community, we can fall down a rabbit hole of anxiety and  
When Everyday Feels Like Groundhog Day.  my finger on it, but it felt a whole lot like the 1993 comedy ‘Groundhog Day  long of being stuck in what feels like the exact same day on repeat  
Well, life sometimes feels stuck just like with the characters in that movie. Learn how to fix that. You might be going through life feeling pretty happy and then all of a sudden, you realize you’ve hit a dead end. Life seems stuckboring, and fairly uneventful. It feels like you are going through the motions just like in that film  
Of course, there’s more to it than that but the saying ‘my life feels like groundhog day;’ comes from that film. And if you’ve ever used that phrase yourself, you’ll know exactly what I am talking about. Here are my top 3 tips on how to get yourself out of a rut and get rid of feeling like you’re experiencing Groundhog day. 1. 
The combination of boredom—from too many days that all look virtually identical—and anxiety—that’s all the anxieties: health, economic, social, political—works together to make it seem as if time is moving in slow and disorienting ways, and every day feels like the movie Groundhog Day. 
We can feel like we’re spinning our wheels. We can feel like we’re just going through the motions. We can feel like we are powerless to change our circumstances. We can feel hopeless. I was there recently. The last bit of 2022 was hard for me. I felt like I was stuck in that loop. There were days I didn’t get out of bed. Days that were a  
In the 1993 comedy, Groundhog Day, Bill Murray plays Phil Connors, a grouchy weatherman covering Groundhog Day in small-town Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. After getting stuck in Punxsutawney due to an unexpected snowstorm, Phil finds himself waking up on February 2—Groundhog Day—every single morning. Phil is not impressed.

A few weeks into my family’s quarantine, it started to hit me just how much every day felt like a carbon copy of the one before: wake up, make coffee, juggle the demands of my work and kids, remember to eat, go to bed, repeat. 
Groundhog Day has become a shorthand term for the feeling that each day feels exactly the same and you are in a rut. When each day seems like it is on repeat, it can leave you feeling bored and  
Every day feel like 'Groundhog Day'? Here’s how to break up the monotony. Vivian Manning-Schaffel. Updated Wed, June 10, 2020 at 9:44 PM UTC. 6 min read. Every day feel like 'Groundhog Day

Work feels like Groundhog Day sometimes, regardless of your role. I’ve spoken to people who routinely handle complex situations, but even the challenges can feel redundant. The conversation goes like this ‘nothing is wrong. It’s just that nothing is exciting. I feel blah.” 
In the 1993 comedy, Groundhog Day, Bill Murray plays Phil Connors, a grouchy weatherman covering Groundhog Day in small-town Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. After getting stuck in Punxsutawney due to an unexpected snowstorm, Phil finds himself waking up on February 2—Groundhog Day—every single morning. Phil is not impressed. 
I work from home full time and am in grad school part time. I have a great support system but still feel socially isolated with how limited my socialization is right now. I just feel numb and every day feels the same. I am in therapy and otherwise my life is good, every day just feels the same. 
Because as we face the actual Groundhog Day this year, the truth is that many of us can feel like we’re stuck in a mental or emotional Groundhog Day, just like Murray. We can feel like we’re spinning our wheels. We can feel like we’re just going through the motions. We can feel like we are powerless to change our circumstances. 
In short, boredom often feels uncomfortable and is a common denominator in most unhealthy or self-destructive behaviors. Luckily, there are things you can do to combat boredom, even during this pandemic where every day feels like Groundhog Day. Remember that movie “Groundhog Day?” 
When every day feels the same, we can become less motivated and unproductive under such conditions. Groundhog Day Syndrome can decrease enthusiasm at work, hobbies, and even in relationships. 3. Emotional Fatigue and Apathy. Groundhog Day Syndrome is characterized by emotional exhaustion, apathy, indifference due to monotony involved. 
Every day feels exactly like the last. I have no motivation, no satisfaction, no pleasure, nothing to look forward to. I’m completely detached from time, from reality, from myself. It could be the same day as 6 months ago and I wouldn’t be able to tell a single difference. 
3. Unravel your rhythms. Once you’ve developed a pattern of how and when you create, turn it upside down every now and then. If you usually sketch in the mornings, brew a pot of coffee and draw  </p>
