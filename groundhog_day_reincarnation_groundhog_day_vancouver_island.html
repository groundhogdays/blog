The Role of Karma and Reincarnation. The repetitive cycle in “Groundhog Day” can be likened to the concept of karma and reincarnation. Phil’s journey reflects the idea of re-living lives (days) until reaching an enlightened state. 
The 1993 film Groundhog Day features egotistical weatherman Phil Connors, played by Bill Murray, reliving the same day over and over. While the movie is beloved as a comedy, many religious scholars consider it an “underground Buddhist classic” for its depiction of the cycle of death and rebirth. 
Phil is no longer alone, and we are left wondering about the intended theological meaning of Phil’s repetition of the same day for many years. If Groundhog Day is meant to imply reincarnation, for example, then why is Phil always himself—the same man—every single time, never progressing or regressing through other species as reward or

It is not just that he is just living the same day over and over in a time loop, he has to keep living the same day in Punxsutawney (a city with a strange name and history). The whole groundhog festival should be examined as well for its very strange symbolism, including everyone in top hats (the sign of the 1800s controllers). 
It's possible that he died in the blizzard on the first day of the loop, but it might have also been an earthly miracle - he'll never really know. Phil lived his life constantly pushing others away, trying to be aloof, above, and fake. He made himself miserable this way, crafting himself a living hell that got worse every day. 
For me, among the best of comfort films is Harold Ramis’ 1993 comedy masterpiece, Groundhog Day.  One theory is that the movie is an allegory for reincarnation and the Buddhist religion. Some  
In Jo Walton's novel Lent, a Groundhog Day-like form of reincarnation known as metempsychosis is an essential part of the damnation and punishment of demons, although some have more Ripple-Effect-Proof Memory than others.

Unlike reincarnation, the main character in the movie “Groundhog Day” remembered and learned from his past mistakes (or “karma”), benefited in the present, and made a conscious choice to apply the wisdom of his experience to insure a blissful future. In a nutshell, here’s the Hindu teaching on the Afterlife: 
It's February 2nd, and movie fans prepare themselves for Groundhog Day with one of the most deeply philosophical films ever made.  Phil Connors' Cycle of Reincarnation . Close. 
In Groundhog Day, for example, when cynical TV weatherman Phil Collins discovers he is trapped in a time loop, living the same day over and over, only to be released after transforming his character from an egocentric narcissist to a thoughtful and kindhearted philanthropist, it’s hard not to be reminded of the Hindu notion of samsara, a  
About Reincarnation. When starting a new life, you will forget most things from before. However, you can relearn everything much faster depending on the highest level you achieved in previous lives.

Initially, Phil is driven insane by his curse, but eventually learns to use his time to better himself and treat everyone in Punxsutawney with kindness, finally getting Rita's (Andie MacDowell) approval and ending the never-ending Groundhog Day loop.
