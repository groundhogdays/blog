        <p>Groundhog Day (1993) - Goofs on IMDb - bloopers, mistakes, errors in continuity, plot holes, anachronisms, spoilers and more. 
Groundhog Day (1993) - Continuity - (at around 33 mins) During the police chase scene on the railroad tracks, there is a shot where the train's headlights illuminates the tracks in front of Phil's car. In that shot we can see that there is no break in the tracks. In the next shot they veer off the tracks, via a road without any rail crossings, and escape. 
The one in blue is holding a yellow sign upside down that says Phil (the groundhog, not the character). The first 3 days in a row they are together as they should be. On the fourth day and every day thereafter the woman in blue is by herself which does not follow the exact day sequences. (00:21:25 - 00:35:25) chiefs58

Enjoy these funny Groundhog Day jokes and puns! Groundhog Day is observed on February 2nd each year, and according to legend a groundhog will pop its head out of the ground on this day. If it sees his shadow, i.e. it’s a clear day out, the winter will continue for six more weeks. If, however, it sees a cloudy day, it means spring will be  
10. Did the Groundhog catch some fog the other day? No, he mist. 11. What did Obi-Wan say to Groundhog? If every day feels like Groundhog Day, maybe it’s time to paws and reflect! 12. Why is Punxsutawney Phil always cold? Because he has many fans. 13. When does a groundhog come before a woodchuck? In the dictionary. 
But Groundhog Day has earned another meaning in the past three decades. In the 1993 movie “Groundhog Day” starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell, Bill Murray’s character, Phil, enters a time loop and relives February 2 over and over. Groundhog Day has since taken on the colloquial meaning of repetition and déjà vu.

See how the groundhog became a symbol for predicting seasonal changes in America, rooted in German folklore with a badger — which in turn lead to Groundhog Day. 
In honor of Punxsutawney Phil and Groundhog Day, the holiday, we've resurrected some of the best "Groundhog Day" quotes from the famous comedy movie. Poor Phil Connors (played with excellent drollness by Bill Murray) was forced to wake up day after day, reliving each run-in with Needlenose Ned, his producer Rita, and his cameraman, Larry. 
Groundhog Day Movie bloopers, mistakes goofs and flubs. Plus Bloopers and mistakes in movies, TV, books, and more. Thousands of bloopers make it into even the biggest movies, and some of these mistakes are very entertaining, if you know where to look. 
In Groundhog Day, time seems literally endless. But for us, on this Earth, time is a finite thing—and often, the time given to us feels oh so short. Because of Groundhog Day’s time loop, Phil Connors has the opportunity to live the day again and again—correcting mistakes, perfecting approaches, honing himself into, well, a decent human  
Groundhog Day (1993) - Revealing mistakes - When Phil is helping the ladies with the flat tire, he's using a jack to raise the car. Two shots are used (one showing Phil, the other showing the ladies in the car) as Phil is jacking the car up. But the car never gets any higher off of the ground like it's supposed to. It just bounces up and down to the original starting point. 
Groundhog Day (1993) - Revealing mistakes - In the beginning of the bowling alley scene there is a shot looking down the lanes toward the pins. Above lane 7 there is a sign that clearly says in big red letters, "Now Forming, Fall Leagues."

At the Groundhog Dance near the end of the film, Phil introduces the pair, now married, as "Debby and Fred Keisler." Either they already had the same last name, Fred took Debby's last name, or somebody screwed up. 
Groundhog Day (1993) - Incorrectly regarded as goofs - Phil, Rita, and Larry arrive in Punxsutawney, and, as they get out of the van, Phil announces he's not willing to stay in the hotel and Rita tells* him he's got a reservation at a Bed &amp; Breakfast across town. Phil is thrilled and climbs back to the van, in the passenger's seat, but there is no driver, because the driver is Larry and he is  
Groundhog Day (1993) - Factual errors - The waitress asks the armored car workers for a roll of quarters; armored car workers absolutely cannot make change for anyone. In reality, the waitress would have needed to go into the bank and get change from a bank teller. 
Incorrect mistakes and their corrections for Groundhog Day (1993).
