        <h2><strong>do u have school on groundhog day did groundhog day pass</strong></h2>
        <p>Groundhog Day is February 2. That’s a Sunday. So, of course, we have to learn about groundhogs before then. Well, Friday would be the day. That happens to be our 100th day of school. But this year, we all were feeling a little blah about the 100th day, so we decided as a team to celebrate the 101st day of school! 
Groundhog Day is not one of the 11 official U.S. Holidays so school is held unless it falls on a weekend. More info on Groundhog day can be found at National Day Calendar. 
From the very first day of school, have your students track the number of days they’ve been in school in anticipation of the 100th day, marking the days in ten bundles, paving the way to counting by tens and ones. Have students work in groups to come up with one hundred ways to represent the number “100”. Some examples are: 50+50; 102-2  
The short answer is, it depends. Groundhog Day, celebrated on February 2nd, is a unique holiday that is usually not observed as a federal or state holiday. This means that schools and businesses usually operate as usual. However, some schools and institutions may choose to celebrate Groundhog Day with special activities or events. 
It also give students a bit of the “science” behind Groundhog Day and talks about making predictions. So much learning all in one book! Groundhog Day Activities for the Classroom. Speaking of making predictions, here are a few activities to use BEFORE and during Groundhog Day. 
1993 - Columbia Pictures releases the movie, "Groundhog Day," starring Bill Murray.In the years following the release of the movie, crowds numbering as high as 30,000 have visited Gobbler's Knob  
The first Groundhog Day was celebrated on Feb. 2, 1887, at Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney. The holiday has roots in a few different religions, but it took a similar message from each of them. 
Every February 2, we celebrate Groundhog Daybut do you know why we celebrate on this specific date, or why a groundhog? Learn these facts and more in this fun Groundhog Day mini-unit study! (PreK-5th grades) Books to Read: Groundhog Day! by Gail Gibbons (non-fiction) The Night Before Groundhog Day by Natasha Wing Groundhog's Runaway Shadow 
Do you have your Groundhog Day activities and crafts ready for the classroom yet? It may be one of the quirkier holidays on the American school calendar, but February 2 is a fun one to mark in the elementary classroom — and not just because kids love finding out whether there will be six more weeks of winter or an early spring. 
Your young learners may not know what a groundhog is, let alone why we have a day to celebrate it each year. They might not understand why thousands of people gather in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, on a cold morning every February to watch a man in a tuxedo hold a groundhog—while many more watch the ceremony live on television. 
These Groundhog Day coloring pages are so cute, filled with groundhogs in all kinds of fun scenarios. Plus they’re all free for you to download and print! Use our printable coloring pages for libraries, classrooms, birthday parties, or any time you want to color this fun collection of groundhog color pages. 
Starring Bill Murray as Phil Connors, a cynical weatherman who finds himself reliving the same day over and over again, Groundhog Day mixes humor with philosophical themes. Alongside Murray, the film stars Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliott. Groundhog Day received critical acclaim upon release and has since become a cultural touchstone. 
The Knob will be open February 1, the day BEFORE Groundhog Day, until 4:00pm. The Knob closes to vehicular and pedestrian traffic for site and festivity preparation. The Knob opens back up to vehicular traffic on February 2 nd around 10 am, after all buses have transported visitors off the Knob. 
As the most famous Groundhog Day celebration in the world, you might be able to assume that the ceremony at Gobbler’s Knob is not the only event Punxsutawney hosts for Groundhog Day. Indeed, there will be numerous events and activities throughout the week leading up to 2025 Groundhog Day, like brewery parties, a talent show, and a bar crawl. 
When the kids have their groundhog masks made, have them put them on and complete an obstacle course while wearing the masks. Say: Today is Groundhog’s Day. That means that very early this morning, a groundhog had to make his way out of his home and into the cold to “predict” how long it will be until winter ends. 
61 votes, 91 comments. We always talked about it in 1st~3rd grade this time of year. Wondering if it’s a regional thing since it’s based in PA 
Groundhog Day doesn’t have to be just another winter day—it’s such a fun excuse to get crafty and play a few games! With these 23+ ideas, you’ll have plenty of ways to keep the kids engaged and smiling, whether you’re at home or in the classroom.

However, Punxsutawney Phil will let us know Sunday, Groundhog Day, when we can expect spring to officially arrive. Danny Rubin attended Gainesville High School and was the screenwriter for “Groundhog Day” the movie, a 1993 comedy featuring Bill Murray. Via video, he introduced Mayor Harvey Ward on Wednesday.
