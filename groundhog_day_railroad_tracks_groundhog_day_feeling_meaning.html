        <p>Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis, with a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin. It stars Bill Murray, Andie MacDowel 
**I do not own this and no copyright is intended*** Groundhog Day is a 1993 film directed by Harold Ramis. It was added to the United States National Film Re 
I viewed "Groundhog Day" for the first time in many years. It seems that Bill Murray was driving on railroad tracks when he almost get hits by a "train" locomotive BN 6244 (a very clean locomitive!). I assume that it was filmed at the IRM at night with "fog" to keep it realistic. 
Oh, yeah: “Don’t drive on the railroad track.” Gus: Well, Phil, that’s one I happen to agree with. Don’t drive angry! Phil: (Holding Phil the Groundhog behind the wheel) Don’t drive angry. Don’t drive angry! I’m betting he’s going to swerve first. (Driving down the railroad tracks toward an approaching train) 
The scene where Bill Murray drives the Cadillac down the railroad track was filmed at the Illinois Railway Museum in Union IL. The locomotive which appeared in the scene was BN 6244, now preserved at IRM in her original paint scheme and number CB&amp;Q 504. 
Groundhog Day reimagines Punxsutawney as a contemporary version of the sleepy hamlets and simple people that Frank Capra and Preston Sturges celebrated in their classic films of the 1930s and 1940s. Even Needle-Nosed Ned, the insurance agent played by the great Stephen Tobolowsky in the role he will be remembered for, seems like a nice guy.

On the first day Phil wakes in the hotel, he looks out of the window and sees certain cars moving and turning.

Groundhog Day, the 1993 film Ramis directed and co-wrote with Danny Rubin, became an underground Buddhist classic, despite the fact that the words “Buddhist” or “Buddha” never appear in the script, or that neither Ramis nor Rubin intended it to be Buddhist or Christian or Jewish or any of the other denominations that say it speaks to  
Groundhog Day is my favorite movie. I'm 25 years old so it's barely in my demographic to like, if it all. If you haven't seen that movie it honestly is the perfect movie. It's funny, it has a cool concept, and the concept is executed well. It also has a perfect ending. Groundhog Day is the best movie to me.
