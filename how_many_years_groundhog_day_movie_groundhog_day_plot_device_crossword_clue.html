        <h2><strong>how many years groundhog day movie who is the protagonist in groundhog day</strong></h2>
        <p>Groundhog Day was rated PG, allowing children access with parental permission. The film was seen as a potential sleeper success. [61] [62] Groundhog Day was one of many family films released that year, including Free Willy, Last Action Hero, and the highly anticipated Jurassic Park, which would go on to become the highest-grossing film to date  
The premise of Groundhog Day (the movie) is brilliantly simple.  director Harold Ramis said Phil relived the day for 10,000 years before later saying it was probably about 10 years. The movie  
Director Harold Ramis believed Phil Connors was trapped for 10-40 years, adding weight to his loathing of the curse. Initially, the script envisioned a 10,000 year time-loop, but was reduced to  
Bill Murray starred in Groundhog Day in 1993Columbia Pictures. Sign up to our new free Indy100 weekly newsletter. According to Whatculture.com, Bill was stuck in the loop for 33 years and 350 days. That means he was left repeating the same day an incredible 12,395 times. How did they work it out? 
Groundhog Day celebrations went from seeing about 5,000 spectators every year to somewhere around 35,000, President of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, Tom Dunkel, explained to WTAJ. “ I would say it was the catalyst that put Punxsutawney Phil from having 5,000 people come for Groundhog Day to having 35,000 people come for Groundhog Day. 
Woodstock, about 50 miles northwest of Chicago with a population of around 25,000, was once home to filmmaker Orson Welles and was the setting for the 1992 movie Groundhog Day. (Photo by Scott  
Groundhog Day: Directed by Harold Ramis. With Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliott, Stephen Tobolowsky. A narcissistic, self-centered weatherman finds himself in a time loop on Groundhog Day. 
Groundhog Day (1993) - According to the website Wolf Gnards, Bill Murray spends eight years, eight months and sixteen days trapped in Groundhog Day. The Movie Truth review series calculated Murray spent 4,576 days (twelve years, six months, and eleven days) stuck in the loop. 
1993 - Columbia Pictures releases the movie, "Groundhog Day," starring Bill Murray.In the years following the release of the movie, crowds numbering as high as 30,000 have visited Gobbler's Knob  
Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, February 2. Today, of all days, Pittsburgh TV weatherman Phil Connors is about to experience a bizarre phenomenon during the town's annual coverage of the Groundhog Day festival. 
The most false, when it comes to Groundhog Day, is the widely-reported notion that an early version of Rubin's script had Phil explicitly saying to Rita that he had been "waiting for you every day  
Article content. Nearly three decades after its premiere, the 1993 movie Groundhog Day has reached a new level of relevance under COVID-19. The world’s locked-down, working-from-home millions  
So, there you have it. The amount of time Bill Murray remains trapped in Groundhog Day’s time loop: 33 years, 350 days. Quite a bit longer than Wolf Gnards’ prediction or Ramis’ original 10 years, but certainly better than the 10,000 years the original script called for. 
However, in a commentary special feature of the movie, director Harold Ramis said Phil relived the day for 10,000 years before later saying it was probably about 10 years. The movie itself never actually reveals that detail, however, Whatculture.com ran some numbers and revealed the number was likely over 12,000 days, which would come to  
According to WhatCulture.com — which meticulously took into account the 38 days actually shown during Groundhog Day; the 414 days that were mentioned; the 11,931 days Phil spent learning things like ice sculpting, French poetry, and playing the piano; and the days he spent performing good deeds — Harold's second estimate was much closer. 
In honor of Groundhog Day last week — when Punxsutawney Phil predicted an early spring (so we got that going for us [and, yes, I am mixing my Bill Murray movie references]) — Gallagher pinpointed the exact number of Groundhog Days Murray's Phil Connors endures in “Groundhog Day:” 12,403 days. 
Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years. Deezen noted that the second draft of the screenplay called for Phil to be cursed to live the time loop for 10,000 years. In the DVD commentary, Ramis estimated a real-time duration of 10 years. 
Phil relives the same day approximately 12,400 times in Groundhog Day, equating to almost 34 years. Groundhog Day director Harold Ramis initially believed Phil was trapped for 10 years, but later went back on his stance. 
TIL the number of days Phil (Bill Murray's character) repeated Groundhog Day in the movie was 38, but in actual time it was calculated to be 8 years, 8 months and 16 days.
