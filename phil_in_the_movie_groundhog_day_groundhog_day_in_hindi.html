        <p>Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly.

Groundhog Day (1993) cast and crew credits, including actors, actresses, directors, writers and more. 
Groundhog Day celebrations went from seeing about 5,000 spectators every year to somewhere around 35,000. “I would say it was the catalyst that put Punxsutawney Phil from having 5,000 people come for Groundhog Day to having 35,000 people come for Groundhog Day. That was the impact that the movie had.“ 
Groundhog Day - Phil's a God: Phil (Bill Murray) tries to explain to a skeptical Rita (Andie MacDowell) that he is a God.BUY THE MOVIE:  
Groundhog Day: Directed by Harold Ramis. With Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliott, Stephen Tobolowsky. A narcissistic, self-centered weatherman finds himself in a time loop on Groundhog Day. 
Initially, Phil is driven insane by his curse, but eventually learns to use his time to better himself and treat everyone in Punxsutawney with kindness, finally getting Rita's (Andie MacDowell) approval and ending the never-ending Groundhog Day loop.

Over the course of the movie, Phil engages in a litany of activities ranging from binge-eating and one-night stands to various suicide attempts, only to find himself once again waking up on Groundhog Day. He also picks up a number of talents over the course of the film, including playing piano, sculpting ice, and speaking French. 
They arrive in town a day before the festival, and Phil’s Groundhog Day starts early at 6 am. The morning kicks off with Phil listening to a weather report on the radio, which predicts a blizzard in Punxsutawney. Phil reluctantly dresses for Groundhog Day and feels disdain for the festival and its concept. 
Groundhog Day got a resurgence of popularity in 1993 when the film of the same name came out. Groundhog Day stars Bill Murray as Phil, of course, who finds himself living the same day in repeat after visiting Punxsutawney to report on their groundhog and if he sees his shadow or not. The movie was inspired by a book about vampires 
The arrival of annual Groundhog Day celebrations Friday, Feb. 2, 2024, will draw thousands of people to see celebrity woodchuck Phil at Gobbler's Knob in Punxsutawney, Pa. — an event that  
Groundhog Day had many people rolling in laughter when it came out in 1993, just as it does today. Perhaps the most memorable aspect of this film is the brand of comedy embodied by Bill Murray’s  
Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is an arrogant Pittsburg weatherman who looks down on everyone around him and treats his coworkers poorly. His least favorite part of the year is when the network sends him to cover Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, so when he finds he's stuck in an endlessly repeating Groundhog Day, it's a living nightmare. 
Phil Connors' job in the movie is a TV weatherman, as depicted in the film "Groundhog Day". Throughout the movie, Phil is shown reporting on the weather for a local news station, showcasing his role as a meteorologist on television. 
“I would say it was the catalyst that put Punxsutawney Phil from having 5,000 people come for Groundhog Day to having 35,000 people come for Groundhog Day. That was the impact that the movie had.“ 
Students may note Phil’s treatment of the homeless old man. At first Phil ignores the old man. Later Phil gives him money and during another Groundhog Day Phil takes him to the hospital. On that day, Phil is obviously emotionally committed to the old man, demanding to see the chart and refusing to accept the nurse’s evaluation of the situation. 
Starring Bill Murray as Phil Connors, a cynical weatherman who finds himself reliving the same day over and over again, Groundhog Day mixes humor with philosophical themes. Alongside Murray, the film stars Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliott. Groundhog Day received critical acclaim upon release and has since become a cultural touchstone. 
In fact, the term "Groundhog Day" has become synonymous with both the phenomenon and the film trope of someone reliving the same day over and over in other movies like Groundhog Day. The film may be iconic for its brilliant utilization of the premise, but Groundhog Day 's ending still leaves many questions unanswered, including the exact number  
2. Road Trip to the Groundhog Day Bed &amp; Breakfast. Visit the Cherry Tree Inn B &amp; B, where Phil Connors stayed in the movie Groundhog Day. The historic Victorian home is a classic. It’s about one-hour northwest of Chicago. Founded in 1844, the city of Woodstock features a town square and brick-paved roads. 
For Phil, the nasty, self-centered weather forecaster played by Bill Murray in “Groundhog Day,” that hell reveals itself one morning in the Groundhog Capitol of Punxsutawney, Pa. He has journeyed there to do a remote broadcast about his namesake, the groundhog Punxsutawney Phil, who every year informs the nation whether it will have six  </p>
