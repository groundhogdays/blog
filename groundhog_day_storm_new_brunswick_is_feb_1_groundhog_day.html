The "Groundhog Day Storm" of February 2-3, 1976, battered all coastal areas of the province. Although only one river basin was reported to have been affected, the original estimates of storm damage exceeded $10 million ($24.9 million in 1998 dollars).

New Brunswick tried to start a tradition with Oromocto Ollie a few years ago, but I think the prognosticating paparazzi were too much for him. The most famous New Brunswick groundhog might be Shediac’s mascot for the community’s winter carnival, Bonhomme Couèche! Here are a few groundhog facts, with thanks to the wonderful Wiarton Willie. 
The 2011 Groundhog Day blizzard [3] [4] [5] was a powerful and historic winter storm that affected large swaths of the United States and Canada from January 31 to February 2, 2011, especially on Groundhog Day. 
The origin of Groundhog Day in Milltown, New Jersey, traces to a promise a guy named Jerry Guthlein made to his sick wife in the mid-1990s.  The quiet before the storm. The Milltown Wranglers  
5 things to know about the Groundhog Day storm. 1. It struck on Feb. 2, 1976. The storm packed winds of 160 km/h in southwestern N.S. In Grand Manan winds hit 202 km/h. 2. The fishing industry in southwestern Nova Scotia was heavily impacted, Boats were damaged or sunk. Wharfs were broken apart. And thousands of lobster traps went missing. 3. 
Moncton had almost no snow on the ground during the last two weeks of January 1992. Shortly before noon, January 31, a major storm started. Over the next 54 hours, the city received 161 cm (63 inches) of heavy, wet snow. Our 10 h.p., 28 inch (71 cm) snowblower has started to clear the driveway. It was in use 6½ hours clearing about 15 metres of driveway. The 1986 Dodge B-250 van remains well

Word on the street this groundhog day is that we are in for another six weeks of winter. As we brace for yet another winter storm heading our way later 
“This Groundhog Day storm was kind of an extreme example of that.” Part of the legacy of the Groundhog Day storm is the storm surge warning program forecasters use. Warnings are issued if water levels are expected to reach a certain threshold. That the 1976 storm coincided with very high tides made it even more damaging. </p>
