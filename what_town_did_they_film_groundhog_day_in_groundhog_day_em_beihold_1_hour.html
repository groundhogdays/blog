The Groundhog Day Ceremony was recorded on Woodstock Town Square, near the gazebo. The Northen Federal Savings Bank is the Chase Bank at 118 Cass Street. Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, is a real-life town, hosting the annual Groundhog Day since the 1800s. The event is attended every year by thousands of visitors from around the world.

For those who haven’t seen the film, the premise revolves around Murray’s character, the bitterly egocentric TV weatherman Phil Connors, reliving the same day over and over again after being snowed in following a broadcast from the Pennsylvanian town of Punxsutawney. That particular day is 2 February, otherwise known as Groundhog Day, when  
The Woodstock Opera House, 121 Van Buren St., was used during filming of the 1993 movie "Groundhog Day." Though the movie is set in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, most of it was filmed in Woodstock  
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
Bill Murray could have woken up on Groundhog Day in Mineral Point, Wisconsin, not Woodstock. The town came close to becoming the film location for Murray’s iconic 1993 film, “Groundhog Day.” As anyone with any knowledge of either the film or Woodstock knows, Murray’s character ended up repeating his day in Woodstock.
