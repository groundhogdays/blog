        <h2><strong>50 first dates groundhog day groundhog day how many days did he repeat</strong></h2>
        <p>Just in time for Valentine’s Day, “50 First Dates” is a spin on the “Groundhog Day” notion of a day that keeps repeating itself. This time, though, the recycling takes place entirely inside the mind of Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore), who was in an accident that caused short-term memory loss. Every night while she sleeps, the slate of

50 First Dates is a stale cupcake of tasteless Sandler-movie clichés heavily iced with sweet sentiment. What could’ve been a funny Valentine upholding noble romanticism and sacrificial love turns out to be a crass, run-of-the-mill comedy aimed at 14-year-old boys fascinated by the noises they can make with their armpits. 
"50 First Dates" "The Wedding Singer" meets "Groundhog Day"? Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore shine in this sweet, flirty comedy about a man who falls for a woman with short-term memory loss.

A harmless feel-good romantic comedy with Adam Sandler on usual form as a bit of a commitment-phobe. That is, until he meets "Lucy" (Drew Barrymore") and he really thinks he has found true love. The snag is that she has some pretty serious short-term memory issues and so each time they meet, he has a sort of first date groundhog day to get through.
