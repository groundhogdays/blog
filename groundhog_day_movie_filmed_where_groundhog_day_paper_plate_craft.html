Bill Murray’s memorably excellent 1993 comedy Groundhog Day is an evergreen classic, but it’s gained extra significance under lockdown, with the expression ‘It’s just like ‘Groundhog Day’’ repeated, well, on what seems like a daily basis. For those who haven’t seen the film, the premise revolves around Murray’s character, the

Why was Groundhog Day filmed in Woodstock? 
Today Detective Brett Hopper will be accused of shooting state attorney Alberto Garza. He will offer his rock solid alibi. He will realize he's been framed. And he will run. Then he will wake up and start the day over again. Detective Charlie Crews was framed, convicted and cleared for a crime he
