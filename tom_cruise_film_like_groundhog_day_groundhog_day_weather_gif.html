        <h2><strong>tom cruise film like groundhog day groundhog day and existentialism</strong></h2>
        <p>Action movie star Tom Cruise puts in a performance that exceeds expectation in Edge of Tomorrow, a sci-fi movie that takes the concept of Groundhog Day and runs in a totally different direction, all while playing with action movie tropes to deliver something great. 
Emily Blunt and Tom Cruise star in 2014’s sci-fi movie Edge of Tomorrow, which takes the idea of repeated time cycles to epic new levels. Cruise’s military commander must battle invincible  
While there have been plenty of time loop movies over the years, many have used the concept to dramatic effect, like in 12 Monkeys and Source Code.However, the classic 1990s comedy Groundhog Day helped popularize the time loop comedy subgenre in which a character is stuck reliving the same day over and over again until they figure out how to break the loop, leading to all kinds of hijinks as  
This carefully curated list brings together the best movies that deliver the magical narrative style reminiscent of Groundhog Day.Each recommendation has been handpicked and then further refined by the enthusiastic votes of Ranker fans like you, ensuring that it resonates with audiences who enjoy the unique blend of humor and existential themes. 
Best Tom Cruise movie in the last 20 years.  Like groundhog day, constant daily loop Palm Springs Boss Level Not constant daily loop, but still stuck in a timeloop  
Movies that, like Groundhog Day, have a time loop of 24 hours or less.  Director Doug Liman Stars Tom Cruise Emily Blunt Bill Paxton. 10/10. 3. Source Code  
Like Emily Blunt and Tom Cruise in  Groundhog Day. Because obviously. The Bill Murray comedy could be a reason that the other movies on this list exist. But none quite live up to the original. 
Run Lola Run. Far from mimicking Groundhog Day specifically, this breakthrough German film for director Tom Tykwer and actress Franke Potente has other cinematic cousins, more so those following  
“Edge of Tomorrow” a.k.a. “Live. Die. Repeat.” (2014) This is one of Tom Cruise’s late, great, underrated roles. We watch him die on an endless loop as he tries to learn how to win in a  
The Doug Liman-directed adaptation of “All You Need Is Kill” gave an action sci-fi spin on the Groundhog Day concept. In this time loop movie, Tom Cruise stars as a cowardly military PR  
The trade paper said the film was similar to Oblivion, a 2013 science fiction film that also starred Tom Cruise, and that like Oblivion, it would likely perform better outside North America. [62] Box Office Mojo reported that four of Cruise's films with original material— Valkyrie (2008), Knight and Day (2010), Jack Reacher (2012), and  
Today Detective Brett Hopper will be accused of shooting state attorney Alberto Garza. He will offer his rock solid alibi. He will realize he's been framed. And he will run. Then he will wake up and start the day over again. Detective Charlie Crews was framed, convicted and cleared for a crime he  
Edge of Tomorrow: Directed by Doug Liman. With Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt, Brendan Gleeson, Bill Paxton. A man fighting in a war against aliens must relive the same day every time he dies until he can find a way to stop their power source with the help of an elite soldier. 
Groundhog Day isn't the only movie to feature characters trapped in a time loop. We run down 14 other films that have a similar plot.  • Tom Tykwer’s action classic takes the time looping  
(I kind of like that detail 'cause it make the whole training and wining thing more convincing. ) So, I believe Tom Cruise's training was not so long. Perhaps about 300 loops like Rita did? A tells us Cruise might spend more time than the novel, B tells the opposite. My guess is still around 393 loops, but defiantly fewer than The Groundhog Day. 
Edge Of Tomorrow, Doug Liman’s click-clacky sci-fi take on Groundhog Day, stars Tom Cruise as a smarmy press flack who get stuck in a time loop during an alien invasion.An entertaining, effects  
There have been many time loop movies in the history of cinema, including beloved titles like "Palm Springs" and "Groundhog Day." But there's never been one quite like "Edge of Tomorrow," which  
Here it is, the 2014 summer blockbuster to beat: Doug Liman’s Edge of Tomorrow (forgive the awful title) is a high-concept, high-powered ride through – and through, and through – a D-Day-like assault on an alien menace that has invaded Europe, with our hero (played by Tom Cruise) continually waking up on the eve of destruction every time
