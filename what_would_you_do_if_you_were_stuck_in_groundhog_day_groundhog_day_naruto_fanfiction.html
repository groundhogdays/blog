        <h2><strong>what would you do if you were stuck in groundhog day punxsutawney hotels for groundhog day</strong></h2>
        <p>So, if you are living in fear in a Groundhog Day type scenario then you can guarantee the next day will start over. This is just a theory of mine. I honestly believe Groundhog Day is a grossly underrated movie. Another movie that kind of follows this theme is Stranger than Fiction with Will Ferrell. Love that movie too. 
According to Stephen Tobolowsky, Ramis told him that the entire progress of Groundhog Day covered 10,000 years. "I always thought that there were nine days represented [in the film], and Danny Rubin, the writer, said that he felt something like 23 days were represented in the movie, [but they lasted] over 10,000 years." 
Phil is stuck on repeat in Punxsutawney, PA, on Groundhog Day, probably not the place or holiday he would have chosen. If you could pick any holiday to repeat over and over again, which one would it be? Jenn: Halloween. Spooky costumes and copious amounts of candy win hands down every time. 
Phil: What would you do if you were stuck in one place and every day was exactly the same, and nothing that you did mattered? Ralph: That about sums it up for me. Groundhog Day is the masterpiece that slips you by. Everybody knows The Godfather is the cinematic version of the Sistine Chapel’s ceiling. Bertolucci is the directorial Beethoven. 
The film is full of moments that play on various levels: purely comedic, dramatic and thematic. If you make the effort of looking through the veneer of the Hollywood blockbuster, you'll find a movie that makes profound statements about the human state. No need to wrestle through French cinema if you want to discover pure cinematic genius. 
The best move/book/TV premise of all time is the Groundhog Day premise: reliving the same day/hour/event over and over again until you are able to solve the riddle holding you in stasis. 
What would you do if you were stuck in one place, and every day was exactly the same, and nothing that you did mattered? There is something so familiar about this. Do you ever have déjà vu? I wake up every day, right here, right in Punxsutawney, and it's always February 2nd, and there's nothing I can do about it. 
What would you do if you were stuck in one place and every day was exactly the same, and nothing you did mattered? That’s the essential question asked by “Groundhog Day.” It’s also the exact line of dialogue uttered mid-way through the film by its lead character Phil Connors, the snide, superior local 
Groundhog Day wonderfully exemplifies the power of approaching each moment as though it were a completely new experience. This is perfectly conveyed in Buddhist practice. This is perfectly  
"Groundhog Day" begs the question, what would you do if you were stuck repeating the same day forever? The 1993 film was directed by Harold Ramis, known for his previous work producing "Caddyshack  
1. In the bowling alley, Phil asks two locals, “What would you do if you were stuck in one place, and every day was exactly the same and nothing that you did mattered?” One of the locals replies, “That about sums it up for me.” What are the filmmakers trying to tell us in this exchange? Suggested Response: There are a number of ways to  
A great memorable quote from the Groundhog Day movie on Quotes.net - Phil: What would you do if you were stuck in one place and every day was exactly the same, and nothing that you did mattered? Ralph: That about sums it up for me. 
Harold Ramis’ 1993 movie “Groundhog Day” is so entertaining, you’ll want to see it again, and again, and again. Explore meanings and central themes in the movie. 
Groundhog Day (1993) Rick Overton as Ralph.  What would you do, If you were stuck in one place, and every day was exactly the same, and nothing you could say,  
Bill Murray asks the big question 
Bill Murray’s character offers a good lesson for us all, stuck, as we are, in a perpetual pandemic Groundhog Day, and dreaming, as we are, of tomorrow. 
Imagine the look on everyone's face when you answer their questions before they can ask them! Imagine how cool you'd look when you catch something falling behind you without breaking eye contact! Basically, it would eventually become Groundhog Day. Hell, I'd probably just start taking the day off to practice and learn an instrument. 
“What would you do if you were stuck in one place, and every day was exactly the same, and nothing that you did mattered?”  Watching Groundhog Day every day for a year provided me with a  
Groundhog Day: Directed by Harold Ramis. With Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliott, Stephen Tobolowsky. A narcissistic, self-centered weatherman finds himself in a time loop on Groundhog Day. </p>
