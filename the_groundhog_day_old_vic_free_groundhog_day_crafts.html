A review of Groundhog Day, the musical version by Tim Minchin and Danny Rubin on at the Old Vic until August 2023. Better than the original! 
He originated the role at the Old Vic in 2016, and later played Phil in Groundhog Day on Broadway. Karl won an Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Musical, and earned a Tony Award nomination for Best Actor. The first “Groundhog Day” celebration of its kind took place at Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, on 2 Feb. 1887. 
“Groundhog Day” premiered at the Old Vic in 2016, and went on to win a slew of awards. Fittingly for a musical about a man who finds himself living the same day over and over,

Groundhog Day The Musical can be seen at The Old Vic in London until 19 August 2023. Paul was given a complimentary review ticket.

It is Groundhog Day for Groundhog Day. Tim Minchin’s musical adaptation of the much-loved 1993 movie first appeared at the Old Vic in 2016, but its subsequent Broadway run was cut short and an  
I just saw Groundhog Day in London at the Old Vic last night andholy cow! I knew the story since it’s one of my favorite movies, knew one song, and knew I was dying to see Andy Karl in person. Beyond that, I pretty much went in blind. </p>
