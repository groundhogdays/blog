Groundhog Day might be about a single man forced to relive the same day over and over, but one sequence raises philosophical questions that go well beyond a single individual. Even though Phil Connors’ life resets every February 2 at 6:00 a.m., the movie also shows that for each Groundhog Day he experiences, the world still continues on for  
Bill Murray shines in one of his best roles, with a great supporting cast. The storyline is timeless and endlessly entertaining. The existential themes of Groundhog Day are deeply meaningful.

Groundhog Day (1993) was one of the most critically acclaimed and popular American film comedies of the nineteen-nineties, admired both for its warm-hearted romance and for the delightful comic absurdity of its central premise. 
The movie Groundhog Day, starring Bill Murray, might not strike you as a deep source of ethical instruction, but Joseph Kupfer [1] plumbs its storyline to reveal some delightful ethical insights. He notes that the movie starts with Nietzsche’s idea of the eternal return [2] as a prompt about reflecting on our life and whether it is good  
In his book, How to Write Groundhog Day (2012), screenwriter Danny Rubin tells us, “The first note [after the film premiered] I remember came from a monk in Germany. He had discovered Groundhog Day as a perfect articulation of his Christian beliefs” (Parker 2013). The movie’s director Harold Ramis talks about his mother-in-law who lived

Ever since the 1993 film from Harold Ramis and Bill Murray, the term “Groundhog Day” has become synonymous with mundane repetition and mindless redundancy in our daily lives and jobs.
