        <p>So, there you have it. The amount of time Bill Murray remains trapped in Groundhog Day’s time loop: 33 years, 350 days. Quite a bit longer than Wolf Gnards’ prediction or Ramis’ original 10 years, but certainly better than the 10,000 years the original script called for. 
Bill Murray's role as Phil Connors in 1993's Groundhog Day is one for the ages, especially considering he hated his experience behind-the-scenes just as much as his character did onscreen! 
Article content. Nearly three decades after its premiere, the 1993 movie Groundhog Day has reached a new level of relevance under COVID-19. The world’s locked-down, working-from-home millions  
In fact, the term "Groundhog Day" has become synonymous with both the phenomenon and the film trope of someone reliving the same day over and over in other movies like Groundhog Day. The film may be iconic for its brilliant utilization of the premise, but Groundhog Day's ending still leaves many questions unanswered, including the exact number  
According to WhatCulture.com — which meticulously took into account the 38 days actually shown during Groundhog Day; the 414 days that were mentioned; the 11,931 days Phil spent learning things like ice sculpting, French poetry, and playing the piano; and the days he spent performing good deeds — Harold's second estimate was much closer. 
The most false, when it comes to Groundhog Day, is the widely-reported notion that an early version of Rubin's script had Phil explicitly saying to Rita that he had been "waiting for you every day  
It might be one of the most influential comedies ever made, but there’s a hidden truth about Groundhog Day which might actually make it one of the scariest horror films of all time. The 1993 film, which is set on February 2nd and based around Punxsutawney folklore, sees Bill Murray’s weatherman Phil Connors trapped in a time loop on the  
In honor of Groundhog Day last week — when Punxsutawney Phil predicted an early spring (so we got that going for us [and, yes, I am mixing my Bill Murray movie references]) — Gallagher pinpointed the exact number of Groundhog Days Murray's Phil Connors endures in “Groundhog Day:” 12,403 days. 
In around June 2009, a blog post from "Wolf Gnards" purported to have calculated the duration of time Bill Murray's character spent in the time loop featured in "Groundhog Day." According to their findings, Phil Connors was stuck in the loop for a period totaling eight years, eight months, and 16 days. 
In one early version of the script it stated that phil spent 10000 days (27 years) repeating the same day. Many people contemplate this though and argue that he only spent around 10 years. Either way, its still a LONG time. 
Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years. Deezen noted that the second draft of the screenplay called for Phil to be cursed to live the time loop for 10,000 years. In the DVD commentary, Ramis estimated a real-time duration of 10 years. 
This may be the source of the idea that Phil was stuck in Groundhog Day for 10,000 years. Movie commentary by the director. These quotes are from the Special 15th Anniversary Edition DVD of Groundhog Day, in the audio commentary by the director, Harold Ramis. 7:58 into the movie, in reference to the writer, Danny Rubin: He's something of a Zen  
Here is what you need to know about Groundhog Day: the day dedicated to a weather-predicting rodent.  In 1886, Groundhog Day was acknowledged for the first time in Punxsutawney by a local  
The Knob will be open February 1, the day BEFORE Groundhog Day, until 4:00pm. The Knob closes to vehicular and pedestrian traffic for site and festivity preparation. The Knob opens back up to vehicular traffic on February 2 nd around 10 am, after all buses have transported visitors off the Knob. 
The film is about a TV weatherman called Phil Connor, played by Ray Murray, who, for some unexplained reason, is stuck in a time loop and wakes up every day on the same day and in the same place: 2nd of February, Groundhog Day, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The focus of the story lies in Phil’s character arc and development.

Yet another hollow Feb. 2nd will pass in Milltown without the glory of a marmot’s meteorological prophecy.  Its Groundhog Day was “magical,” said Korman, who started hosting Groundhog Day  
Video above: Rare albino groundhog spotted in the Susquehanna Valley.The Groundhog Day celebration at Gobbler's Knob started in 1887. Aside from a 10-year gap, records for each prognostication  
Figuring that the assault is launched around 0800, gives him around somewhere around 16-18 hours of prep time before the assault. He lasts maybe 5-10 minutes on the first few initial times. Then you get to the harder part: how much time passes at each training and beach guide point. 
Groundhog Day is a tradition observed regionally in the United States and Canada on February 2 of every year. Although Phil will give his prediction around 7:20, many faithful followers arrive hours beforehand around 4 a.m. Standing room only. </p>
