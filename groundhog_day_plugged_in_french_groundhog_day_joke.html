        <h2><strong>groundhog day plugged in do we have school off on groundhog day</strong></h2>
        <p>In Groundhog Day, time seems literally endless. But for us, on this Earth, time is a finite thing—and often, the time given to us feels oh so short. Because of Groundhog Day’s time loop, Phil Connors has the opportunity to live the day again and again—correcting mistakes, perfecting approaches, honing himself into, well, a decent human  
Parents need to know that Groundhog Day is a beloved comedy starring Bill Murray as a smug and selfish weatherman who must live through the same day over and over again until he learns the value of caring about others and eventually demonstrates gratitude and perseverance. Although it's mostly a lighthearted comedy, it also deals with  
Therefore for Groundhog Day the curse of a single repeating day symbolized the 2,922 days that Bill Clinton would be in control of the most powerful levers of power in the world. This is why the song that plays each morning is “ I got you ” And just like the other media I decoded, the film is an appeal for people to flip to 666. 
When counting down for the camera to start, Phil counts with his thumb, first, and middle fingers using his middle finger last. However, it is easy to miss. 
Bill Murray stars as a jaded, selfish TV weatherman, who finds himself in a time loop: he’s forced to repeat the same day over and over, while reporting on Groundhog Day festivities. Also with Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliot and Stephen Tobolowsky. Directed by Harold Ramis. [Running Time: 1:43] 
“Groundhog Day” stars Bill Muray as an egotistical TV weather man who has been sent to Punxsutawney, PA to cover Groundhog Day (February 2nd). He is rude to everyone he meets and has no human charity whatsoever. After the “first Groundhog Day” Bill Murray goes to sleep and awakens to find that it is the same Groundhog Day all over again  
The same day would be less hellish if you weren’t stuck in some little pissant town away from home. Like if you woke up in your own bed every morning (assuming no weather issues), you could immediately get up and drive to the airport and go somewhere different each day. Obviously you’d only get half or at most two thirds of a day there. 
Plugged in: It's Groundhog day! Do you pay attention to what Punxsutawney Phil has to say? Are you hoping for an early spring? Does the pandemic 
Although GROUNDHOG DAY emphasizes that man desires not to be accountable for his deeds, it falsely implies that man can save himself from his sinful propensities. Even so, the film is humorous, lighthearted and fun though somewhat redundant. Thus, a discerning viewer will come out ahead as he learns “There is nothing new under the sun.” 
If you’re looking for something a little different to break the monotony of the winter season, here are some fun and unique ways to celebrate Groundhog Day. 1. Watch Groundhog Day—and Live It Like Bill Murray! Let’s be honest: Groundhog Day (the movie) is as synonymous with the holiday as the actual groundhog. Bill Murray’s comedic  
Roughly based on a journey through the five stages of grief, Groundhog Day drills deeply into one of life’s biggest issues: meaning. 
While at the screening for this Tom Cruise actioner, I overheard someone say that Edge of Tomorrow was sort of a combination of the romcom fantasy Groundhog Day and the sci-fi blaster Starship Troopers. And that’s likely to be the type of cinematic comparisons many will make. 
This repeat-a-day flick features a college girl with a hangover who lives out her birthday with a sneer before being brutally murdered. Over and over and over. 
By the end of the first Happy Death Day film in 2017—which was something of a Groundhog Day-goes-to-college horror-comedy—boozy party gal Tree learned her lesson, found her way to becoming a better person and fell in love with a nice-guy college geek. And that movie’s shadow-creeping masked murderer was as dead as a cratered ping pong  
Well, it’s February again, that month of Super Bowls, sweet valentines and Groundhog Day. This year, however, it looks like the streaming services have really kept their heads buried when it comes to streaming sweet family friendly movies for you and the kids to gobble up.

When he finally asks his little sister about her soccer game, she tells him that they lost, 0 to 3. He thinks about that for a while—knowing that she’s essentially living that bitter loss, day after day, cycle after cycle. One day, he goes to that same game. And he watches his sister score a goal. We can’t know whether his sister’s team

Also: 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (G, 1954, Disney+) starring the recently departed Kirk Douglas; Fiddler On the Roof (G, 1971, Amazon Prime), a beloved (if somewhat depressing) movie about a Jewish milkman and his three daughters; Groundhog Day (PG, 1993, Netflix), a funny, philosophical comedy starring peak Bill Murray; Murder on the Orient  
Ever since Groundhog Day came out in 1993, the idea of a person being stuck in a time loop, forced to live the same day over and over, has been a popular film trope. Of course, most of those other films require the stuck person to fix the events that happened that day or to have some sort of moral epiphany. Not so with Palm Springs. </p>
