Developed and directed by Matthew Warchus the production has a stellar cast and team.The production is bright, brassy, and very Broadway. There is everything from puppetry to magical illusion, corny costumes, and fabulously detailed props like Phil's bedroom accompanied by an array of musical and dance styles from marching band to disco, gospel, and tap dancing. 
Groundhog Day The Musical is fast-paced, slick and performed by an uber-talented cast led by Andy Karl as its linchpin character: egotistical TV weatherman Phil Connors.

Review by Suzanne Tate . Opening Night of Groundhog Day: The Musical was a highly anticipated event for me. I am a huge Tim Minchin fan and was excited to see how his satirical comedic wit and mind-blowing musical ability would transform the popular 1990s movie through the addition of his music and lyrics.

Review by Naomi CardwellThe arrival of Groundhog Day: The Musical in Melbourne has me nervous. Tim Minchin’s epic production about a TV weatherman with a god complex has blown in on a storm of accolades by way of London and Broadway, following the runaway success of Minchin and director Matthew Warchus’ brainchild Matilda the Musical. But musicals based on films seem like a reversal of  
Synopsis. A beloved comedy classic is brought to the stage in Groundhog Day.Phil Connors, a sarcastic and self-centered TV weatherman from Pittsburgh, dreads his trip to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, every year, where he is forced to report on the annual Groundhog Day festivities. 
Ingeniously crafted, deliciously funny, and warmly uplifting, Groundhog Day the Musical is modern musical theatre at its sophisticated best. With the original smash hit London 2016 season having won the Olivier Award for Best New Musical, Groundhog Day the Musical went on to play on Broadway in 2017, again starring Best Actor winner Andy Karl. </p>
