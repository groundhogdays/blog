Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film which follows the eccentric weatherman Phil Connors, played by Bill Murray. Every day Phil wakes up to find himself living the same day over and over again in a surreal time loop, where he remains trapped in the town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania.

Groundhog Day is anchored by uplifting songs that make a complex foundation for a quirky film. Sonny &amp; Cher’s epochal “I Got You Babe” heralds the dawn in the protagonist's eternal holiday, while “Phil’s Piano Solo” represents his fitful transformation from miserly weatherman to lovable humanist. 
While a fun musical number to see onstage, the genius of the track also lies in the music: The whole journey’s underscored with songs previously heard the show — in fact, it’s pretty much all of “Day One” as an instrumental — but given that Phil’s no longer an a**hole, the music is given new life.
