        <h2><strong>how many times has groundhog day been wrong groundhog day possum</strong></h2>
        <p>Sadly, the groundhog is often wrong when it comes to his predictions. Since making his first prediction in 1887, Punxsutawney Phil has been right 39% of the time, according to the Stormfax Weather  
However, the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club — which claims the same groundhog has been making predictions since the 1800s thanks to drinking the "elixir of life" — alleges, without evidence, that  
Phil has seen his shadow more times than not, predicting a longer winter 84% of the time. Since 1887, he has seen his shadow 107 times and has not seen it 19 times. He saw a partial shadow once; it did not appear once, and there was no prediction recorded 10 times. The origin of Groundhog Day. The tradition of Groundhog Day is similar to the  
Every Feb. 2 since the 1880s, nationally known as Groundhog Day, it has been a tradition to wake Meteorologist Hall of Famer Punxsutawney Phil from a stump on Gobbler’s Knob at 7:25 a.m. EST to see his prediction on whether or not winter is almost over. Legend has it that if Phil sees his shadow, then there will be six more weeks of winter. 
He has seen his shadow the most, as he has predicted a longer winter 107 (84%) times. Here's are all of his results since 1886: Saw shadow (six more weeks of winter): 107 
In the near term, the groundhog’s accuracy rate is slightly worse. According to the NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information, Phil has been right about 30% of the time over the past decade. ANIMALS OTHER THAN PUNXSUTAWNEY PHIL THAT WILL TRY TO PREDICT END OF WINTER ON GROUNDHOG DAY. In 2021, Phil predicted more winter. 
The first known record of Groundhog Day was in a local paper in 1886 in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. Since 1887, Phil has seen his shadow 105 times, indicating there is a long winter in store, according to the NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information. Phil has predicted an early spring only 20 times and there is no record for 10  
The rodent has been predicting the start of spring since 1887.  Phil the groundhog has been forecasting the seasons on Groundhog Day at Gobbler's Knob in Punxsutawney since 1887, but just how  
But the groundhog and his handlers get it right more often than not. In 118 years of available records, our calculations show Phil and his translators have been correct about 64.4 percent of the time. 
Punxsutawney Phil is absolutely infallible. He has never, in his 131-year history, ever been wrong about whether or not winter will continue. However, some of the predictions about the winter made on Groundhog Day have been incorrect. In 130 predictions, Phil has predicted a long winter 103 times and an early spring 18 times.

But how many times has Phil been right? Turns out his track record for weather prediction isn’t 100%  or even 50%. Since 1887, Phil and his predecessors have seen their shadow 104 times, and  
Since 1988, the groundhog has been "right" 14 times and "wrong" 17 times.  More:Don't look for Punxsutawney Phil to deliver us from winter weather on Groundhog Day. Phil was "wrong" last year

Punxsutawney Phil has seen his shadow 97 times, has not seen it 15 times, and nine years are unaccounted for. 2. The National Climatic Data Center reportedly stated that Phil's prediction's have been correct 39 percent of the time. This number is in conflict with Phil's club, which states he's been right 100 percent of the time. 
Groundhog Day 2024: Watch livestream of Punxsutawney Phil as he looks for his shadow How often is Punxsutawney Phil right? Sadly, the groundhog is often wrong when it comes to his predictions  
Believe it or not, the actual number of times Murray’s Phil Connors relives the same day might actually surprise a fair amount of people. As it stands, according to calculations by one intrepid  
Here’s a look at the history of Punxsutawney Phil’s Groundhog Day predictions for an early spring or six more weeks of winter. 
In fact, the term "Groundhog Day" has become synonymous with both the phenomenon and the film trope of someone reliving the same day over and over in other movies like Groundhog Day. The film may be iconic for its brilliant utilization of the premise, but Groundhog Day 's ending still leaves many questions unanswered, including the exact number  </p>
