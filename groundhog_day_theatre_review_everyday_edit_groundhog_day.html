        <p>Review. Groundhog Day. 5 out of 5 stars  Theatre, Musicals; Recommended. Friday 9 June 2023.  ‘Groundhog Day’ is a surprisingly profound exploration of how to live a good life by  
Inspired by the beloved film starring Bill Murray, Groundhog Day is a Broadway and West End smash hit musical.Phil Connors is a pretty awful guy. But when this cynical Pittsburgh TV weatherman is sent to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities, he finds himself trapped in a blizzard and stuck in a time loop that spins him on an uproarious journey toward self  
Jay Dysart is phenomenal in the lead, a Phil Connors with a more frenetic, brittle edge than the stillness of Murray’s film version. As the musical unfolds you watch his Connors spin through detached disbelief to detached hedonism to acceptance of his fate without ever feeling less attached to his arc.Repetition is an art of infinite variety as it’s practiced by Jay Dysart in GROUNDHOG DAY  
Dispatched with novice producer Rita (Tanisha Spring) to smalltown Punxsutawny, Pennsylvania, where a groundhog predicts the weather every February 2nd, Phil puts the moves on anyone female and  
Andy Karl brightens ‘Groundhog Day’ — theater review . From: NY Daily News | By: Joe Dziemianowicz | Date: 4/17/2017 If a groundhog sees its shadow, there'll be six more weeks of winter. If  
Groundhog Day continues to be the best reviewed show in Landmark’s history, and this latest review from Greggory Moore at Random Lengths News highlights some of our favorite parts about this production. Excerpts below and read the full article online here. 
Groundhog Day Another incredible review of Groundhog Day: The Musical has landed – this time in the Long Beach Press Telegram and Grunion Gazette. Everyone at Landmark is beyond thrilled with the continued incredible reception that this show has received from both critics and audiences alike. 
‘Groundhog Day’: Theater Review. Andy Karl steps into the Bill Murray role of jaded TV weatherman Phil Connors, stuck on a loop in small-town Pennsylvania in this musical adaptation of the  
Time loop: Andy Karl oozes charisma in Groundhog Day's starring role . Manuel Harlan. Henry Hitchings 17 August 2016. Review at a glance.  Latest theatre reviews. 1/50. 
Review by Suzanne Tate . Opening Night of Groundhog Day: The Musical was a highly anticipated event for me. I am a huge Tim Minchin fan and was excited to see how his satirical comedic wit and mind-blowing musical ability would transform the popular 1990s movie through the addition of his music and lyrics. 
‘Groundhog Day’: Theater Review. Director Matthew Warchus, composer Tim Minchin and the team behind 'Matilda' turn the much-loved Bill Murray screen comedy into a lavish stage musical. 
If you see "Groundhog Day," there'll be 2 hours and 45 minutes of kinetic and sometimes witty but ultimately wearying antics. Fortunately, there's a silver lining: musical-comedy dreamboat Andy Karl, who puts his own irresistible stamp on the arrogant TV weatherman played in the 1993 film by Bill Murray." 
Inspired by the beloved film starring Bill Murray, Groundhog Day is a Broadway and West End smash hit musical. Phil Connors is a pretty awful guy. But when this cynical Pittsburgh TV weatherman is sent to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities, he finds himself trapped in a blizzard and stuck in a time loop that spins him on an uproarious journey toward self  
Our very own theatreCat Libby Purves reviews the return season of Groundhog Day at the Old Vic Theatre, London. Groundhog Day. Old Vic Theatre . 5 Stars . Book Tickets. WELCOME BACK TO PUNXATAWNEY . Seven years after its premiere at the Old Vic earned a flurry of Oliviers, by way of a pandemic and a disappointingly short Broadway run, here it  
If any show was tailor-made for repeat viewings, it’s Groundhog Day.It’s not just the inspired time-loop premise of Danny Rubin’s tale – first seen in his 1993 existential romcom movie, then in this stage musical adaptation with Tim Minchin for the Old Vic in 2016 – but the extraordinary intricacy of both writing and staging, which mean that each encounter with it reveals new wonders. 
Review by Naomi CardwellThe arrival of Groundhog Day: The Musical in Melbourne has me nervous. Tim Minchin’s epic production about a TV weatherman with a god complex has blown in on a storm of accolades by way of London and Broadway, following the runaway success of Minchin and director Matthew Warchus’ brainchild Matilda the Musical. But musicals based on films seem like a reversal of  
For this show to work the casting of Phil Connors is essential. Here Roc Bernardi (La Jaula De Las Locas, Teatre Tivoli, Barcelona) convinces as initially arrogant, prepared only to make easy choices at 1st before learning that the way out of the repeating day he finds himself marooned in is to be kind and be loved by others. 
The day in question is Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney, an annual event when a large rodent predicts the end of winter. There is some rewriting but the added value is Tim Minchin ‘s smart music. Apart from boasting some amusing lyrics, the songs add more emotional depth to the main protagonist. 
Seven years after its premiere, the Groundhog Day musical is back at the Old Vic. Andy Karl is still playing cynical weatherman Phil Connors, condemned to relive a single day over and over. And I still love it. 
On paper, the happy new musical “Groundhog Day,” which opened on Tuesday night at the Old Vic Theater here, seemed like one of those shows that elicit instant groans of “been there, done  </p>
