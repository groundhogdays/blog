Groundhog Day isn't scientific (in fact, Punxsutawney Phil's weather predictions are wrong most of the time). If we're being honest, it even defies common sense. 
**It's like Ask Science, but all questions and answers are written with answers gleaned from the universe itself.** Use in-universe knowledge, rules, and common sense to answer the questions.
