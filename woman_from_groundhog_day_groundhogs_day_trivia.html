Marita Geraghty. Actress: Groundhog Day. Marita Geraghty was born on 26 March 1962 in Chicago, Illinois, USA. She is an actress, known for Groundhog Day (1993), Sleeping with the Enemy (1991) and Broadcast News (1987). 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
In 1993, MacDowell achieved stardom due to the box office success of director Harold Ramis's fantasy romantic comedy film Groundhog Day, starring opposite Bill Murray. Critics were enamored with MacDowell's performance. Gene Siskel said that she lit up the screen when she was on. [18] 
After Groundhog Day, Doyle-Murray appeared in Bakersfield P.D. and The George Wendt Show in the mid-'90s, going on to pick up roles in As Good as It Gets (1997), Snow Dogs (2002), and 17 Again (2009).

When the movie Groundhog Day premiered in February 1993, it became an instant classic - earning more than $105 million at the box office and becoming one of the highest-grossing films of that year. 
Nancy is initially portrayed as a seemingly naïve woman; however, as the film progresses, she shows her depth and complexity. Groundhog Day also included noteworthy performances from Stephen Tobolowsky as Ned Ryerson, the overly enthusiastic insurance salesman, and Brian Doyle-Murray as Buster Green, the Groundhog Day official.

PETA’s proposal for a Groundhog Day cake. On January 21, PETA—along with its president, Ingrid Newkirk—issued a statement detailing why it wants to swap Phil the Groundhog with a cake. They also wrote a letter to Punxsutawney Groundhog Club’s president, Tom Dunkel. 
But, according to groundhog.org, "Punxsutawney Phil is the only true weather forecasting groundhog. The others are just impostors." How old is Punxsutawney Phil? Punxsutawney Phil is reportedly
