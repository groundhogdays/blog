        <h2><strong>is groundhog day good reddit groundhog day uk cast</strong></h2>
        <p>Groundhog Day (1993) is the perfect film The core of the film is character development, Bill Murray is so deep in character, there feels like there are some borderline method moments. His comedic timing &amp; acting is unique, subtle &amp; fantastic. 
I just don't get how groundhog day has such high ratings when to me it's just like any other average 90's feel good movies that you take your kids with. I don't get how it's ranked among the other greats like the godfather and amadeus as great movies. Can anyone convince me that I'm wrong or make me realize that it is actually a great movie? 
Also my all time favorite. I always really like comedies that are light on the plot, where it just seems to be 90 minutes of random shit happening. Groundhog Day, Friday, Office Space, Superbad, The Other Guys, etc. 
I think “Groundhog Day” is the best movie ever made. The story of a cursed man gaining redemption is my favorite.The 1993 film starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell is like classic literature. 
Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) By CNN.com Wire  Bill Murray stars in “Groundhog Day,” a romantic comedy about a self-centered television weatherman who has only one day to  
But long before the days of Reddit, "Groundhog Day" has been a touchstone for religious analysis.  rather than ascending to an unknown realm for his good deeds, is allowed to return to his life  
Groundhog Day marked a transition in Bill Murray's career. In the early '90s, Bill Murray was at the beginning of the end of his "movie star" Hollywood phase, a period lasted for almost the entire 1980s; soon afterGroundhog Day, he would be making one of his first inimitable turns as a character actor, in Tim Burton's Ed Wood. 
I’ve said for years that they should announce Groundhog Day 2, have Bill Murray do a big press tour about the challenges of filming a sequel so far removed, etc., and then just re-release Groundhog Day in theaters. 
Lessons from "Groundhog Day": More resonant than ever today The Bill Murray comedy is 25 years old this month, and it's the Phil-good movie I need right now 
Groundhog Day is the best vehicle for his brand of silly psychosis since Murray tangled with that pesky gopher in Caddyshack. It's a novel, fanciful comedy premise that sails over any shortcomings  
Groundhog Day (1993) A few days ago I made a post about which Bill Murray movie people thought was his best one, and it brought up a lot of good conversations. Groundhog Day was brought up a lot and rightfully so. I haven’t watched Groundhog Day in a little while so I decided to watch it again today on this lazy Saturday. 
Look up Tim Minchin, the guy who wrote the music to Groundhog Day and Matilda. His music is incredible and he puts on a great live show. Most of his stuff are kind of South Park style humor, smart but crass, so it's not as clean as his Broadway work but still really good. White Wine in the Sun is my absolute favorite Christmas song (it's clean) 
Just gave this a rewatch. 30yrs old now and this movie is amazing. It’s definitely jumped way up the list in my head of all time faves. Unbelievable cast, excellent script, perfect pacing, and just fun. 
Years ago when I was still in high school my teacher thought it would be a good idea for us to watch Groundhog Day. I sure as hell can't remember why, but we weren't going to complain. Anyways about a week later he's gone for the day and they pull in a substitute teacher who was a Legendary bitch, like she just didn't give a fuck. 
He is destined to repeat the day over and over (according to the late comedy genius Harold Ramis "for 30 or 40 years") until he realizes his flaws, corrects them, and becomes a capital-G Good Person. Getting the girl, while initially his objective, is merely a side benefit to the personality transformation in the end. 
DOOM Day by Joshua The Evil Guy (203,219 words, complete; Download: EPUB or MOBI) YAHP/GHF. Harry is repeating the worst day of his life over and over again. Department Of Mysteries Day. Again and Again by Athy (334615 words; Download: EPUB or MOBI) The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. 
Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years. Deezen noted that the second draft of the screenplay called for Phil to be cursed to live the time loop for 10,000 years. In the DVD commentary, Ramis estimated a real-time duration of 10 years. 
The Bodyguard and Groundhog Day are not 80s movies. They came out in the early 90s, and besides that feel really of the decade to me (at least the first part of it). But I take your point that so many movies from the 80s and 90s have been adapted, although I quite liked Groundhog Day personally. Ghost is another example. 
I was watching the movie Groundhog Day (1993, Bill Murray, Annie McDowell), as I do every year on February 2, and I realized how much that movie was like the afterlife test from the Good Place. Phil relives each day over and over, he keeps his memories of what happened before, what worked, and what he learned, and the day repeats only end when
