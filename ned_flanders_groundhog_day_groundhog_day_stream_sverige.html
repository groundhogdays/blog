Stephen Harold Tobolowsky (born May 30, 1951) is an American character actor and writer. He is known for film roles such as insurance agent Ned Ryerson in Groundhog Day [1] and amnesiac Sammy Jankis in Memento, as well as such television characters as Commissioner Hugo Jarry in Deadwood, Bob Bishop in Heroes, Sandy Ryerson in Glee, Stu Beggs in Californication and White Famous, "Action" Jack

In Groundhog Day, Ned Ryerson is the biggest irritant to Bill Murray’s character Phil Conners.  Just as his namesake Ned Flanders grinds Homer Simpson’s gears,  
Ned? Ned Ryerson?. You have to admit that Groundhog Day, the 1993 film starring Bill Murray (which he hated) and Andie MacDowell (who we haven't heard from in awhile), hits different this year.A  
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
Perhaps Ned is the devil in this story - but not the only or primary devil. Perhaps Ned was also merely a victimized pawn, in his own hellish loop, and his escape act was to successfully sell insurance to Phil. Reasons: Ned says his "doozy" quote more than once - not just at the first repetition. 
The 25th anniversary of "Groundhog Day" is a great chance to listen to some fascinating stories from the set, told by Ned Ryerson actor Stephen Tobolowsky 
Ned Ryerson, the pushy insurance salesman from Groundhog Day, is one of the greatest characters to have ever graced the silver screen. According to Danny Rubin in his book “How to Write Groundhog Day” he came up with Ned Ryerson’s personality and job based on an encounter that he had had with an actual insurance salesman. 
Groundhog Day is a beloved comedy film that has stood the test of time, and one of the standout characters is Ned Ryerson. Played by Stephen Tobolowsky, Ned Ryerson is a quirky and persistent insurance salesman who is always trying to sell policies to the film’s protagonist, Phil Connors. 
Hilarious underrated comedy starring Bill Murray who keeps re-living the same day over and over again. If you like the clips, you can pick up the movie here: 
Character Analysis. Ned Ryerson's main purpose in this movie is to test Phil Connors' level of tolerance for annoying people incredibly annoying people.. At the beginning of the movie, Phil has very little patience for people and he meets his match in Ned, who runs up to him on the street and gives him a passionate speech about how the two of them go way back.

There was a 1990s sitcom called Ned and Stacey, and other Neds have appeared in The Simpsons (neighbor Flanders), Groundhog Day and School of Rock.Ned Stark is a prominent, and unusually heroic, character in Game of Thrones, giving the name some new cultural cache, though we can't recommend using his proper name, Eddard. </p>
