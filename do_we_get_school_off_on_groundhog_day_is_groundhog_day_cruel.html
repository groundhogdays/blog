        <p>School Calendar Dates. The academic year typically has around 180 school teaching days for K-12 students. Colleges and universities tend to have shorter academic years. School holidays (also referred to as vacations, breaks, and recess) are the periods during which schools are closed. 
The short answer is, it depends. Groundhog Day, celebrated on February 2nd, is a unique holiday that is usually not observed as a federal or state holiday. This means that schools and businesses usually operate as usual. However, some schools and institutions may choose to celebrate Groundhog Day with special activities or events. 
Groundhog Day is not one of the 11 official U.S. Holidays so school is held unless it falls on a weekend. More info on Groundhog day can be found at National Day Calendar. 
The academic year in the United States (K-12) typically has 180 school days, whereas, universities have shorter years. Some districts approve a number of expected snow days. If the actual number of cancelled days is greater than the scheduled ones, the start of summer vacation may be adjusted to keep the length of the school year the same. 
These are the dates and weekdays for the holiday Groundhog Day in the next years. Feb 2, 2024. Friday. Feb 2, 2025. Sunday. Feb 2, 2026.  San Diego Unified School  
But this year, we all were feeling a little blah about the 100th day, so we decided as a team to celebrate the 101st day of school!

Groundhogs are fascinating animals. 
He was called Br'er Groundhog prior to being known as Phil. Canada also celebrates Groundhog Day. The movie “Groundhog Day” from 1993, starring comedian Bill Murray, made Punxsutawney Phil in Pennsylvania famous worldwide. The film's plot added new meaning to the term “Groundhog Day” as something that repeats itself endlessly. 
PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa. -- Here's a look at Groundhog Day, an American tradition that is meant to predict when spring will arrive. Facts. The groundhog emerges from its burrow on February 2. If the  
Groundhog Day originated from an ancient European tradition called Candlemas Day, where clergy would bless candles and distribute them to ward off the darkness of winter. The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. 
On Groundhog Day, the world looks to Punxsutawney Phil, a groundhog, to tell us if we're in for a long and dreadful remainder of winter or if we can expect spring-like weather to come sooner.

“We love what we can do for the community, and we can’t do it,” a dejected Einbinder told me on Feb. 2, 2024, the third straight year without a groundhog.

Hit upon a theory when watching Ferris Bueller's Day Off and I was shocked I couldn't find it anywhere on the internet. The reason things constantly seem to go right for Ferris Bueller is that he has lived this exact day countless times before a la Groundhog Day or Edge of Tomorrow. 
But why do we check in on the shadow of a groundhog in the deep of winter each year?  Following the popularity of the 1993 Bill Murray movie "Groundhog Day," the event increased in popularity  
Maria Pfister, left, and Liz Alvey, with the Pringle Nature Center, bring out Bristol Bob for his 2023 Groundhog Day winter prediction. This year's program is Sunday, Feb. 2. 
Therefore for Groundhog Day the curse of a single repeating day symbolized the 2,922 days that Bill Clinton would be in control of the most powerful levers of power in the world. This is why the song that plays each morning is “ I got you ” And just like the other media I decoded, the film is an appeal for people to flip to 666. 
Starring Bill Murray as Phil Connors, a cynical weatherman who finds himself reliving the same day over and over again, Groundhog Day mixes humor with philosophical themes. Alongside Murray, the film stars Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliott. Groundhog Day received critical acclaim upon release and has since become a cultural touchstone. 
If you ask the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, the same old Phil has been calling the weather like he sees it for the past 129 years. But why do we celebrate Groundhog Day anyway? It seems a little  </p>
