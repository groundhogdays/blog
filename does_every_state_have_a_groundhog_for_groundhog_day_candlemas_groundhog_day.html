What is Groundhog Day? People flock to Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, on Feb. 2 every year to be a part of the celebrations revolving around Punxsutawney Phil's winter forecast. 
Although some states have in some cases adopted their own groundhogs, the official groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, lives at Gobbler’s Knob near Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania.

Every February 2, tens of thousands of spectators attend Groundhog Day events in Punxsutawney, a borough that’s home to some 6,000 people. It was immortalized in the 1993 film Groundhog Day

Every year on February 2nd, people across North America turn their attention to a small but significant event: Groundhog Day. This tradition, rooted in folklore, revolves around the behavior of a groundhog and its shadow. 
And with that, Groundhog Day was born, celebrated in the United States and Canada every February 2nd, from 1887 until the present day. At first, it might seem like a ridiculous thing to do — how can a groundhog, or a hedgehog for that matter, possibly predict the weather? And what does February 2nd have to do with it?
