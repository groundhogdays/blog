It's been years since I read this book. It was interesting but I thought it was a bit odd. I read book 2 Hollow City as well, but I haven't kept up with the series.

The Groundhog Day Book of Facts and Fun – Wendie Old. This one is packed full of information. It’s set up more like a chapter book – with long paragraphs and TONS of information. I’d compare this to the content that Gail Gibbons’ Groundhog Day! book has, but on massive steroids. 
For that reason, it can be easy to overlook the “smaller” holidays like Groundhog Day. However, in my experience, kids are absolutely obsessed with Punxsutawney Phil and his weather predictions!

Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
Groundhog Day is celebrated on February 2. It is based on the activities of a groundhog coming out of its winter hibernation to check for his shadow. The legend is, if the groundhog sees its shadow on this day, there will be six more weeks of wintry weather. If it doesn’t, then spring weather is right around the corner.

Groundhog’s Dilemma, by Kristen Remenar; illus. Matt Faulkner (Charlesbridge Publishing) — Fiction, Picture Book, Folklore / Fairytales / Myths, Animals, ages 4-6. 
Groundhog Day loop tropes is a good starting place.. A couple I enjoyed that are also on that list is "All You Need Is Kill" by Hiroshi Sakurazaka, a translated novel about a soldier that fights against aliens that have landed/appeared on Earth- I do not highly recommend the movie, the book's way better.
