        <p>Mystery Spot is the 11th episode of Season 3. It premiered on February 14th, 2008. Sam and Dean investigate the disappearance of a man who went missing at a tourist location. While searching the site, Dean is shot and killed by the owner. Sam is devastated but stunned when he wakes up the next morning to find Dean alive and well. As the day unfolds, Sam realizes he is re-living the previous  
Mystery Spot: Directed by Kim Manners. With Jared Padalecki, Jensen Ackles, Jim Beaver, Richard Speight Jr.. Sam relives the same day over and over, continually having to deal with Dean's death. 
A Supernatural season 3 episode can explain a plot hole in the season 15 finale. Sam and Dean Winchester have always brought each other back, or at least tried to. It all started with John Winchester when he traded his soul for Dean’s in season 2, “In My Time of Dying.” 
Dean: Like Groundhog Day. Groundhog Day was a 1993 movie starring Bill Murray, where his character relives the same day over and over. Other references to Groundhog Day include Sam waking to the same song every morning, though in Groundhog Day the song is "I Got You Babe" by Sonny and Cher. 
JOHN WINCHESTER: Back in 1835, Samuel Colt made a gun.  DEAN Like "Groundhog Day". SAM Yes, exactly. Like "Groundhog Day". DEAN, nodding Uh-huh. SAM So you don't  
Sam tries to explain that they're living the same day over and over. (From the Season 3 episode "Mystery Spot")Watch Supernatural on TNT weekdays starting at 
In the episode 3.11 Mystery Spot Sam relives a Groundhog Day-like universe in which Dean dies every day under strange and inevitable circumstances. The color filter that usually darkens the picture and makes every Supernatural episode a bit grainier and bleak looking isn't used for most of the episode, but it comes back just when Zachariah  
The episode, which finds Sam stuck in a Groundhog Day-style time loop that resets after Dean dies, was a brilliant mixture of comedy, angst, and poignancy. By that point in the season, Dean had already made a deal with the crossroads demon to save Sam’s life in exchange for his soul and had sworn to his brother that he was okay with that  
If we see nothing, that might mean that the Trickster just reset the day immediately, without Dean dying as usual. Not So Invincible After All : Dean Winchester, a guy who routinely kills monsters, demons, ghosts, and even gods, dies in a number of rather unimpressive ways, such as choking to death on a sausage and dying from slipping in the  
When Sam and Dean investigate the disappearance of a man who was looking into a tourist attraction known as "The Mystery Spot" -- where the laws of physics don't apply -- Sam is thrown into a repeating loop, living the same day over and over, and watching Dean die each time in a different way as Sam avoids the method that killed him the last time.

Considering Doctor Who is a show that is heavily reliant on the concept of time travel, it should come as no surprise that it has a Groundhog Day episode of its own. In “Heaven Sent,” the Doctor finds himself trapped in a remote castle on Gallifrey, where he’s relentlessly pursued by a terrifying creature known as the Veil, only to be reborn in a glass chamber every time he’s killed. 
Season 6, Episode 15. The show's most meta episode by a mile (which is saying something coming from a series like Supernatural) is "The French Mistake."In order to lose the angels and demons that are looking for them, Sam and Dean are pushed into another universe where Supernatural is a minimally viewed but passionately loved series, and the two play themselves - Jared Padalecki and Jensen  
Sam and Dean Winchester have always brought each other back, or at least tried to. It all started with John Winchester when he traded his soul for Dean’s in season 2, “In My Time of Dying.” Dean then continued the tradition after Sam died in season 2, “All Hell Breaks Loose: Part 1.” An on it went for the majority of Supernatural.

He's seen Groundhog Day almost as many times as he's seen Top Gun, he knows how this goes. It's just not the kind of thing that's supposed to happen in real life  
The season 3 episode "Mystery Spot" saw an interesting take on a premise similar to Groundhog Day, in which Sam is forced to relive the same day over and over again. While this would be a frustrating experience for anyone, it's even worse for the younger Winchester, who is also grieving one of Dean's many deaths in Supernatural. </p>
