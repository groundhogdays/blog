After a lot of development and collaboration with Harold Ramis, Groundhog Day became the screenplay that ranks #3 on the Writers Guild of America's 101 funniest screenplays ever written. Danny Rubin walked through his journey with the story, screenplay and film of Groundhog Day at the 2014 Austin Film Festival. Thanks to AFF's On Story, you can

So that was a fun trip through the Groundhog Day script. Lots of insight into the backstory like the origin of Phil’s time warp. It would have been fun to see Phil destroy the hotel room and shave his head. It also would have been comical to see him trying to hunt the groundhog down in the library. 
From there, Groundhog Day went through a number of changes as the pair decided to lean into the comedic potential of the premise – and lean away from some of the more "indie" and experimental elements of Danny’s original vision for the movie. </p>
