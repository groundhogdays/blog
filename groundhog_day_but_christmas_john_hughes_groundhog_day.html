        <h2><strong>groundhog day but christmas song in groundhog day alarm clock</strong></h2>
        <p>"Christmas Again," starring Scarlett Estevez in a movie with a "Groundhog's Day" spin, premiers on Disney Channel and Disney+ Friday. FULL STORY:  
Christmas on Repeat and A Chance for Christmas are both from 2022, and both have Santa-induced time loops. Both also have white main female characters involved with a black man and in one the protagonist is an Internet influencer and in the other one the protagonist is making a commercial with an Internet influencer. 
1. Groundhog Day. This isn’t set around Christmas time but on February 2nd, or Groundhog Day. Bill Murray is hilariously brilliant in what is perhaps his finest role — a local weatherman doomed to relive the same day again and again. 
Christmas Do-Over brings the time loop concept to the holiday season, with a protagonist reliving Christmas Day repeatedly. The film's focus on personal redemption and improving relationships within a repetitive cycle captures the heartwarming journey seen in Groundhog Day, with a festive twist. Premise: 
At first, Just Another Christmas seems like just another rip-off of Groundhog Day, as Jorge starts to anticipate every beat of the days ahead.But that isn’t because the same day is literally  
12 Dates of Christmas is a festive version of Groundhog Day with maybe a bit of A Christmas Carol thrown in. Amy Smart is reliving her Christmas Eve as she wakes up each time on the floor of a department store. She is selfish, self obsessed and rude. 
Groundhog Day is such a great palate cleanser after Christmas because the holiday is already in the rearview mirror in this film. No one’s talking about Christmas when February 2 is the biggest  
One of my favorite comedies of all time is Groundhog Day. Christmas Again is a Christmas/Disney take on that plot, and, on its own, it makes for a fantastic TV movie. This is my favorite Disney Channel Original Movie, despite it being a recycled premise. The plot centers around a girl with a beautiful name, Rowena. 
I hereby call for a moratorium on Groundhog Day concepts. The Most Generic Christmas-Movie Title of 2022 distinction goes to A Not So Merry Christmas (now on Netflix), a high-concept comedy from  
See how the groundhog became a symbol for predicting seasonal changes in America, rooted in German folklore with a badger — which in turn lead to Groundhog Day. 
It is based on the short story Christmas Every Day by William Dean Howells and takes inspiration from Groundhog Day. Preteen Rowena "Ro" Clybourne (played by Scarlett Estevez) is a high-spirited 12-year-old who is determined to have the best Christmas ever at all costs, in an attempt to help her divorced parents reconcile. 
The Groundhog Day inspirations are obvious in this movie, but it feels fresh with how the time loop mechanic is used as a source of dark humor, cathartic change, and character development. Both Samberg and Milioti bring tons of fun and chemistry to their roles, making Palm Springs one of the most enjoyable in the genre. 
Most holidays fall into two categories: Those honoring historical events or people (Independence Day, Memorial Day, Labor Day, Veterans Day, Mothers Day, Fathers Day, MLK Day) or religious events/people (Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving, St. Patrick's Day, even Mardi Gras [the day before Ash Wednesday] and Halloween [the day before All Saints Day]). 
Recently I am having this deja vu feeling of my life, not in a good way, but feeling a little bit stuck, and then when I woke up this morning (Asia timezone), my gut told me to watch "Groundhog Day". Since I remember I watched a Hallmark movie years ago with similar theme, I went to check and got 2 results after some searching: 
"The lead protagonist has to repeat the same day over and over until she gets it just right. kind of like Groundhog Day but Christmas themed." – AJPanda. 11. Mrs. Santa Claus. 
Last year, the Marion groundhog predicted an early spring, in agreement with his counterpart in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. See Punxsutawney Phil's 2024 prediction in the video player above

This craft is perfect for celebrating Groundhog Day with a creative twist, and it’s super easy to make. Using simple materials and a dash of imagination, you’ll create a charming groundhog scene that’s as fun to craft as it is to display. 
February 2 is Groundhog Day in the U.S. and Canada, though probably everybody in the world knows about this weather-predicting custom since the movie “Groundhog Day” (“Und täglich grüßt das Murmeltier”) with Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell came out in 1993. But I would bet few know of the German origins of this weather lore day. 
Kevin tries to be involved with his son and ex-wife's family for Christmas. During dinner, he thought his Christmas *day* couldn't be more screwed; his son suddenly wishes it was Christmas every day. After that, it was a regular Groundhog's Day. Kevin learns new dance moves and can actually sing. Don't let the caroling fool you.
