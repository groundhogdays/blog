        <p>Critically acclaimed on both the West End and Broadway, Groundhog Day revels in one man's journey of self-discovery, day after day. Inspired by the hilarious film starring Bill Murray, Groundhog Day features a book by original co-screenwriter Danny Rubin, and music and lyrics by Tony Award nominee Tim Minchin (Matilda the Musical).

As he navigates the repetitive day with humor and wit, Phil discovers that true change comes from within. Featuring catchy songs by Tim Minchin, the composer of MATILDA The Musical, sharp comedy, and a poignant message about redemption and love, this musical is a delightful celebration of second chances and self-discovery.

Winner of the 2017 Olivier Award for Best Musical, and based on the iconic film, Groundhog Day is the new Broadway hit that Entertainment Weekly calls, “a wonderfully inventive show, with dazzling energy, creativity, wit, and heart.” And NY1 says, “This is a Groundhog Day to celebrate!
