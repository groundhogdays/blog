        <h2><strong>groundhog day why did he get stuck how many times did phil connors relive groundhog day</strong></h2>
        <p>PHIL : As he crosses to the bed, he accidentally knocks over the suitcase stand, spilling his clothes out onto the floor.-25- He contemplates picking them up for a moment, decides to leave them there, and flops down on the bed. He lies there looking up at the ceiling until the room starts to spin around, then he closes his eyes and quickly  
Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is an arrogant Pittsburg weatherman who looks down on everyone around him and treats his coworkers poorly. His least favorite part of the year is when the network sends him to cover Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, so when he finds he's stuck in an endlessly repeating Groundhog Day, it's a living nightmare. 
Phil was cursed by his ex-girlfriend, Stephanie. After he dumped her she hexed him with a book called 101 Curses, Spells, and Enchantments You Can Do At Home, and he got stuck in a time loop until he evolved into a better person. 
Bill Murray's role as Phil Connors in 1993's Groundhog Day is one for the ages, especially considering he hated his experience behind-the-scenes just as much as his character did onscreen! Despite  
Bill Murray starred in Groundhog Day in 1993Columbia Pictures. Sign up to our new free Indy100 weekly newsletter. According to Whatculture.com, Bill was stuck in the loop for 33 years and 350 days. That means he was left repeating the same day an incredible 12,395 times. How did they work it out? 
Director Harold Ramis, who died in 2014, once told the New York Times that Connors was stuck in Groundhog Day for only 10 years. Later, in a 2009 email to Heeb Magazine, Ramis would revise his  
The movie became so much more human and relatable since none of us knows exactly how we got stuck here either. How I wrote the script for Groundhog Day in less than a week. At the insistence of the studio, he then created a second draft of the script in which Phil was cursed by his ex-girlfriend as an explanation for the time loop. CUT TO: 
The most false, when it comes to Groundhog Day, is the widely-reported notion that an early version of Rubin's script had Phil explicitly saying to Rita that he had been "waiting for you every day  
At first, he didn't get it, and kept to his old ways. He used his newfound abilities to goof off, to pull of tricks, to be higher than others, to try to get what he wanted by placing himself above them. Each time, it brought him only misery, and repeated suicide attempts. Then, he had a break and began to be reborn. 
He's a motherfucking groundhog and he decides when the seasons change. To punish Connors for his hubris, Punxsutawney Phil summoned a freak storm to trap him in his domain, then looped time until Connors learned his lesson. Remember, it's not until Phil Connors delivers his sincere monologue on the beauty of Groundhog Day that his curse is lifted. 
Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years. Deezen noted that the second draft of the screenplay called for Phil to be cursed to live the time loop for 10,000 years. [9] 
In a first draft of the script a spurned ex turns out to be a witch and curses him. This is specifically why, when Phil and Rita kiss at the end of the movie, there's a sound like tinkling bells (or whatever; doing this from memory). That was the moment th 
According to WhatCulture.com — which meticulously took into account the 38 days actually shown during Groundhog Day; the 414 days that were mentioned; the 11,931 days Phil spent learning things like ice sculpting, French poetry, and playing the piano; and the days he spent performing good deeds — Harold's second estimate was much closer. 
GROUNDHOG DAY never explained why Bill Murray's Phil was trapped in time or what broke the spell, but the original script reveals everything.  know that Phil's broken watch is the key and that  
In which case, the number of Groundhog Days that Phil looped through could be greatly increased if he wakes up at 6A every morning and it resets at midnight, then at most he can only experience 18 hours per day, meaning he needs to wake up to 5 mornings just to accumulate 4 full days of experience. 
The great thing about Groundhog Day (or any other great movie) is that it is endlessly rewatchable (a bit of irony there). Last Groundhog Day, February 2nd, one cable channel played Groundhog Day over and over, for the entire day. Nice gag. 
While many people have done the math on how long Bill Murray's character was trapped in the same day - various estimates range from about 500 years up to 10,000 years - the exact reason as to why  
TIL the number of days Phil (Bill Murray's character) repeated Groundhog Day in the movie was 38, but in actual time it was calculated to be 8 years, 8 months and 16 days. 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
In fact, the term "Groundhog Day" has become synonymous with both the phenomenon and the film trope of someone reliving the same day over and over in other movies like Groundhog Day. The film may be iconic for its brilliant utilization of the premise, but Groundhog Day 's ending still leaves many questions unanswered, including the exact number  </p>
