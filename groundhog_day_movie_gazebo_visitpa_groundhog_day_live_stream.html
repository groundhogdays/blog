        <h2><strong>groundhog day movie gazebo groundhog day results over the years</strong></h2>
        <p>The Groundhog Day Ceremony was recorded on Woodstock Town Square, near the gazebo. The Northen Federal Savings Bank is the Chase Bank at 118 Cass Street. Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, is a real-life town, hosting the annual Groundhog Day since the 1800s. The event is attended every year by thousands of visitors from around the world. 
The film locations for Groundhog Day are supposedly in Pennsylvania, but most of the film was shot in Illinois.. There’s a brief moment of scene setting in Pittsburgh, with an aerial shot of the city wedged between the the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers, as cynical TV weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) and his crew head off to ‘Punxsutawney, Pa’ to cover the annual Groundhog Day  
This location dawns a metal plaque stating “location of Groundhog Day Festival Banquet in the film Groundhog Day 1992”. The large gazebo located in Woodstock Square Park is second on the walk. The gazebo is where the Bill Murray’s character “Phil” hears “Pennsylvania Polka” at his arrival in Gobblers Knob. 
Dance in the iconic gazebo as seen in the movie “Groundhog Day.” The soundtrack from the movie plays inside and adds to the ambiance. “Groundhog Day” fans can recapture the magic of Phil and Rita’s romantic snow dance in the historic square gazebo. We had fun recreating the romantic moment where Andie MacDowell and Bill Murray dance  
Fans of Groundhog Day can embark on a self-guided walking tour of filming locations, including the iconic Woodstock Opera House and the town square’s historic gazebo. Unparalleled Hospitality. The Cherry Tree Inn is more than a movie location; it’s a haven of hospitality. 
The Cherry Tree Inn, known as The Cherry Street Inn in the iconic movie “Groundhog Day,” is the primary lodging choice in the area. However, its rooms tend to come with a hefty price tag, often starting at $250 per night, with rates soaring even higher around the Groundhog Day festivities. 
During the filming of the movie, many town locals even brought out their own heaters to keep the cast and crew warm since the movie was shot in the middle of winter. Ever since the making of Groundhog Day in 1992, each year Woodstock residents still get together to celebrate Groundhog Day. Woodstock has its own Groundhog Day festival, complete  
The pavilion in the park is actually a large gazebo, but we built a pavilion for the groundhog that is an exact match to the one in Punxsutawney. They actually sent delegates from Punxsutawney to make sure we were portraying the groundhog ceremony accurately. 
Where was the movie Groundhog Day filmed? Much of the 1993 movie Groundhog Day was filmed in Woodstock, Illinois. Principal photography for the film began on March 16, 1992, and concluded 86 days later on June 10, 1992. 
29 reviews and 68 photos of WOODSTOCK SQUARE "Many scenes from the 1993 movie Groundhog Day were filmed in or around the Woodstock Square Historic District. The town stood in as Punxsutawney, PA in the movie in which Phil Connors played by Bill Murray relives a day over and over. 
On the first day Phil wakes in the hotel, he looks out of the window and sees certain cars moving and turning. The next day (at around 19 mins) he looks out of the window again and sees exactly the same cars etc. as though it is exactly the same time, but the time is different based on the radio show that is at a different point.

Maria Pfister, left, and Liz Alvey, with the Pringle Nature Center, bring out Bristol Bob for his 2023 Groundhog Day winter prediction. This year's program is Sunday, Feb. 2. 
I love Groundhog Day (1993) and I've seen it over a hundred times since it came out. However, I still can't get over finding out that Fred, the young groom -to-be to whom Phil bestows Wrestlemania tickets was played by a 21 yo, then unknown but now legendary actor, Michael Shannon, who would later play General Zod, Elvis, the Iceman, and many more. 
The soundtrack for Groundhog Day (1993) is one of the movie's most memorable elements. Featuring iconic tracks like Sonny &amp; Cher's “I Got You Babe” and Delbert McClinton's “Weatherman". "Pennsylvania Polka" made by Frankie Yankovic, helps to give the movie a fast pace and joyful melody that creates an uplifting atmosphere. 
Groundhog Day: Directed by Harold Ramis. With Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliott, Stephen Tobolowsky. A narcissistic, self-centered weatherman finds himself in a time loop on Groundhog Day. 
Action movie star Tom Cruise puts in a performance that exceeds expectation in Edge of Tomorrow, a sci-fi movie that takes the concept of Groundhog Day and runs in a totally different direction, all while playing with action movie tropes to deliver something great.
