It was forty years ago on February 2nd, 1976 that southwestern Nova Scotia experienced one of the worst storms in recent history. For a storm lasting just eighteen hours, it did hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of damage.

Then a severe winter storm hit, dubbed the Groundhog Day Gale.  Saint John and coastal areas in Nova Scotia experienced 1.6 meters of flooding. 
It was on February 2, 1976 that what is known as the Groundhog Day Gale raged on the Port City with winds of over 180 kilometres an hour which created waves of 12 meters.

The 1976 Groundhog Day storm, during which a high tide coincided with a storm surge, was used as benchmark for flooding. An accurate record of water levels achieved during the Groundhog Day storm was obtained from the tide gauge in Saint John, New Brunswick, which lies across the Bay of Fundy from Annapolis Royal.
