The show is Minchin's second foray into musical theatre following his massive hit Matilda, which was also directed by Old Vic boss Matthew Warchus. Groundhog Day is the adaptation of the 1993 film which starred Bill Murray as weatherman Phil Connors. Connors visits Punxsutawney on the day a groundhog predicts how soon spring will come. 
Groundhog Day – another new kid on the block – has also got a big nod from the theatre world, receiving 8 Olivier nominations. Great news for one of the more ‘veteran’ musicals as Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Jesus Christ Superstar picks up 6 nominations, making it officially the most Olivier Award nominated show in history.

The intelligence in Groundhog Day combined with its unconventional approach in certain aspects leads to some unexpected and rather unique choices. Act two opening with very brief supporting character Nancy (played by Eve Norris) getting her own musical number ‘Playing Nancy’ explaining what it is like to be a one-note character only seemingly there to be used by men only to disappear  </p>
