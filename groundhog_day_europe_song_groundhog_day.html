        <p>The US tradition of the groundhog Punxsutawney Phil emerging on 2 February to herald spring has fascinating origins – and creature parallels across Europe. 
Groundhog Day, the US tradition where the seasons are predicted by a groundhog, was made world famous by the Bill Murray film of the same name. But did you know the tradition's origins lie in Europe? 
The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
It was 1961 before the groundhog was dubbed “Punxsutawney Phil” and the tradition began to attract a wider audience of about 2,000 people. But the biggest change came following the 1993 Groundhog Day movie starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell (German title: Und täglich grüßt das Murmeltier). The crowds soon swelled to 10,000. 
Children used to drag and burn several snowman-like figures throughout the day, and around the end of the 19th century, this behavior was adopted as the holiday's main ceremony, and a giant pyre  
This “interpretation” of Candlemas Day became the norm for most of Europe. As you can read, there is no mention of an animal of any kind in the preceding song. It wasn’t until this traditional belief was introduced to Germany that an animal was introduced into the lore, hence another evolution of February 2nd. 
Groundhog Day is a holiday celebrated annually on February 2nd in North America with origins in ancient European weather lore. Similar traditions can be found in other parts of the world, such as Candlemas Day in Europe and the Chinese New Year in Asia. 
Over time, the Groundhog Day tradition integrated with local customs, creating a unique celebration that persisted through the years. The American tradition has a big focus on Punxsutawney Phil. The event is organized by the “Groundhog Club,” who communicate with Phil in a language known as “Groundhogese” to interpret his prediction  
February 2 is Groundhog Day in the U.S. and Canada, though probably everybody in the world knows about this weather-predicting custom since the movie “Groundhog Day” (“Und täglich grüßt das Murmeltier”) with Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell came out in 1993. But I would bet few know of the German origins of this weather lore day.

"Since the belief and practice almost certainly came from Europe, and since the bulk of Pennsylvania Dutch immigration occurred between 1727 and 1775, it’s likely Groundhog Day was born in that  
Groundhog Day is a holiday celebrated in the United States and Canada on February 2, each year.  Candlemas is usually celebrated on the same day in Europe, and has  
Groundhog Day originated from an ancient European tradition called Candlemas Day, where clergy would bless candles and distribute them to ward off the darkness of winter. The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. 
As the most famous Groundhog Day celebration in the world, you might be able to assume that the ceremony at Gobbler’s Knob is not the only event Punxsutawney hosts for Groundhog Day. Indeed, there will be numerous events and activities throughout the week leading up to 2025 Groundhog Day, like brewery parties, a talent show, and a bar crawl.
