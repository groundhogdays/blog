Where does the phrase ‘Groundhog Day’ come from? 
Groundhog Day celebrations went from seeing about 5,000 spectators every year to somewhere around 35,000. “I would say it was the catalyst that put Punxsutawney Phil from having 5,000 people come for Groundhog Day to having 35,000 people come for Groundhog Day.

The history of Groundhog Day. Groundhog Day is typically celebrated in the US and Canada and began in the 16th century.This holiday is thought to have stemmed from superstition in the community of Pennsylvania or the Pennsylvania Dutch, though Don Yoder, a University of Pennsylvania professor who specializes in part in the study of Pennsylvania Dutch, believes the tradition may date back to  
It gained worldwide recognition thanks to the film “Groundhog Day,” where a television reporter played by Bill Murray relives the same day repeatedly.

Where does the phrase ‘Groundhog Day’ come from? 
It was 1961 before the groundhog was dubbed “Punxsutawney Phil” and the tradition began to attract a wider audience of about 2,000 people.

According to this review answering such questions in the movie itself would have "ruined" it. The original script contained an explanation of the start of the time loop - a voodoo spell - but that was considered a poor idea. 
The director Harold Ramis didn't intend for his movie Groundhog Day to be heralded by religious thinkers as an example of how to live life, but that's exactly what happened after it was released  
Groundhog Day is a 1993 comedy directed by Harold Ramis, starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell. It was written by Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis and based on a story by Rubin.
