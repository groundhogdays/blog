Groundhog Day originated from an ancient European tradition called Candlemas Day, where clergy would bless candles and distribute them to ward off the darkness of winter. The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania.

What Does A Groundhog Burrow Look Like? From the outside, a groundhog burrow will be inconspicuous. There will be a small entrance and four or so exits. There will be mounds of dirt sitting around the medium-sized holes that acts as an entrance. Burrow openings are around 10-12 inches in diameter and have a crescent-like shape mound around the  
What Does A Groundhog Tunnel Look Like? Groundhog tunnels look a lot like those made by moles: they are several inches wide, several feet long, and totally surrounded by dirt. Some people estimate the circumference of the tunnel entrance could be between 10–12 inches around. 
Groundhog Vocalizations. Groundhogs are known to make a wide variety of whistling and screaming sounds, which lead to another common naming, the whistle pig.
