Inspired by the beloved film starring Bill Murray, Groundhog Day is a Broadway and West End smash hit musical.Phil Connors is a pretty awful guy. But when this cynical Pittsburgh TV weatherman is sent to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities, he finds himself trapped in a blizzard and stuck in a time loop that spins him on an uproarious journey toward self  
Dispatched with novice producer Rita (Tanisha Spring) to smalltown Punxsutawny, Pennsylvania, where a groundhog predicts the weather every February 2nd, Phil puts the moves on anyone female and

Groundhog Day continues to be the best reviewed show in Landmark’s history, and this latest review from Greggory Moore at Random Lengths News highlights some of our favorite parts about this production. Excerpts below and read the full article online here. 
Make no mistake, he is the star of this show and what an unforgettable, thoroughly engaging and totally entertaining night of theatre Groundhog Day: The Musical is. The laughs come thick and fast, and the sentiment shines through. It is slick, fanciful and fun, and is playing at Princess Theatre until 7 th April, 2024. Review by Alex First. 
If you see "Groundhog Day," there'll be 2 hours and 45 minutes of kinetic and sometimes witty but ultimately wearying antics. Fortunately, there's a silver lining: musical-comedy dreamboat Andy Karl, who puts his own irresistible stamp on the arrogant TV weatherman played in the 1993 film by Bill Murray." 
Content warning: this review contains references to self-harm and suicide. Phil Connors, the protagonist of Groundhog Day – both in the original 1993 film and in the musical theatre version – is condemned to live the same day over and over again until he learns some fundamental truths about himself, and figures out how he can become a better human being. 
Review by Suzanne Tate . Opening Night of Groundhog Day: The Musical was a highly anticipated event for me. I am a huge Tim Minchin fan and was excited to see how his satirical comedic wit and mind-blowing musical ability would transform the popular 1990s movie through the addition of his music and lyrics.

Reviews are coming in for the Olivier Award-winning musical Groundhog Day at The Old Vic theatre in London.. With music and lyrics by Tim Minchin (Matilda The Musical), and direction by Matthew Warchus, Groundhog Day has a book by Danny Ruben, who co-wrote the screenplay of the original movie, which starred Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell. 
If any show was tailor-made for repeat viewings, it’s Groundhog Day.It’s not just the inspired time-loop premise of Danny Rubin’s tale – first seen in his 1993 existential romcom movie, then in this stage musical adaptation with Tim Minchin for the Old Vic in 2016 – but the extraordinary intricacy of both writing and staging, which mean that each encounter with it reveals new wonders. 
As he navigates the repetitive day with humor and wit, Phil discovers that true change comes from within. Featuring catchy songs by Tim Minchin, the composer of MATILDA The Musical, sharp comedy, and a poignant message about redemption and love, this musical is a delightful celebration of second chances and self-discovery. 
Review by Naomi CardwellThe arrival of Groundhog Day: The Musical in Melbourne has me nervous. Tim Minchin’s epic production about a TV weatherman with a god complex has blown in on a storm of accolades by way of London and Broadway, following the runaway success of Minchin and director Matthew Warchus’ brainchild Matilda the Musical. But musicals based on films seem like a reversal of  
Groundhog Day The Musical is brought to the stage by an award-winning creative team, including composer and lyricist Tim Minchin (Matilda), writer Danny Rubin, and director Matthew Warchus (Matilda, A Christmas Carol). Groundhog Day The Musical most recently played at The Old Vic theatre from 20 May to 19 August 2023. 
Chicago Theatre Review- Recommended "Paramount's latest musical which, appropriately enough, opens in Aurora during the week of the actual Groundhog Day holiday, is pleasant and fun. It's just that the repetitious storyline, which begins as humorous, eventually wears thin and becomes simply annoying. 
The day in question is Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney, an annual event when a large rodent predicts the end of winter. There is some rewriting but the added value is Tim Minchin ‘s smart music. Apart from boasting some amusing lyrics, the songs add more emotional depth to the main protagonist.
