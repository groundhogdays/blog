        <p>Groundhog Day at the Old Vic review: I could watch Tim Minchin and Danny Rubin’s show again and again  And of course, it’s fitting that Broadway actor Andy Karl is back in the role of Phil  
If any show was tailor-made for repeat viewings, it’s Groundhog Day.It’s not just the inspired time-loop premise of Danny Rubin’s tale – first seen in his 1993 existential romcom movie, then in this stage musical adaptation with Tim Minchin for the Old Vic in 2016 – but the extraordinary intricacy of both writing and staging, which mean that each encounter with it reveals new wonders. 
If this production doesn’t end up with a long run in the West End (and it should), it would make a great alternative to the Old Vic’s annual Groundhog Day-like repeat of A Christmas Carol. Groundhog Day The Musical can be seen at The Old Vic in London until 19 August 2023. Paul was given a complimentary review ticket. 
Review of Tim Minchins Groundhog Day musical at The Old Vic, London starring Andy Karl and Tanisha Spring. After 7 years, Tim Minchins musical returns to London in a show that feels refreshingly familiar.

The hit film about a TV weatherman’s endlessly reiterated day in small-town USA moved to the Old Vic stage in 2016; but then its progress became bumpy, despite the awards showered on it and its lead, Andy Karl, on both sides of the Atlantic. Karl was injured during a Broadway preview and the show's US tour didn't happen.

Groundhog Day – The Old Vic, London June 21, 2023 June 20, 2023 5 mins Tim Minchin and Danny Rubin take on beloved 90s film Groundhog Day in a return of their musical version at the Old Vic. Funny, heartfelt and endlessly rewatchable, I may like it better than the original. 
The film’s metaphysical subject matter translates perfectly to the stage, in a production that sidesteps repetition and reworks each identical day with near-genius creativity. Groundhog Day’s

Review. Groundhog Day. 5 out of 5 stars.  It feels like a snowy American echo of another Old Vic hit, ‘A Christmas Carol’ – and one that also deserves to run, and run, and run. 
Their new musical Groundhog Day is a cast-iron triumph, both joyful and profound, incredibly funny and seriously moving. Danny Rubin’s book follows the lineaments of his 1993 film (directed by Harold Ramis and starring Bill Murray ) but the production intelligently reimagines and remixes the ingredients for the stage.

Groundhog Day comes to rest on a note of affirmation all too rarely expressed these days in the world at large: "I'm here and I'm fine," reports Phil, who has come to realise in the tradition of many an emotive musical that a new day can also be the cue for, yes, a new life.
