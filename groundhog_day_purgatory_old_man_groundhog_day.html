        <p>And in Groundhog Day, purgatory is the town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania itself—a place where Phil Connors must undergo his own brand of purification in order to decide the fate of his afterlife. 
If Rita can only give clues, then directing Phil’s obvious affection study tortured lovers and Purgatory would be a good start to his eventual salvation. 3. Danny Rubin. Danny Rubin was the writer of the original screenplay for Groundhog Day, and even wrote a book entitled How To Write Groundhog Day. In the book, Rubin admits that he only had  
Purgatory, therefore, is not Hell-lite as non-Catholics might assume; it is a gift of God’s mercy — a chance to become perfect as He is perfect. Groundhog Day’s Purgatory is not strictly dogmatic Catholic teaching, but it is more digestible than Purgatorio. Nevertheless, Connors takes a similar pilgrimage to Dante’s Pilgrim. 
National Review scribe Jonah Goldberg, for one, noted the film’s expansive resonance with the Catholic concept of purgatory, the Hindu and Buddhist takes on reincarnation, and the Jewish understanding of mitzvahs, or good works. I’d suggest Groundhog Day can also be read as a fable of Christian sanctification. 
Groundhog Day is an excellent film that Catholics should absolutely see. Catholics should also note the movie is not just “an agnostic explanation of purgatory.” To clarify, Groundhog Day is not just “an agnostic explanation of purgatory.” The ‘Catholic lens’ produces a ‘valid interpretation.’ 
‘Groundhog Day’ is all about purgatory The Catholic concept of purgatory, a spiritual realm where souls must linger until they expiate their remaining sins and earn their way into heaven, fits  
The 1993 classic Groundhog Day is one of the best depictions of Purgatory in any art form, alongside Dante Alighieri’s Purgatorio, the second chapter in the Italian poet’s Divine Comedy. Now a film that features a rodent named Punxsutawney Phil, small-town folks (some obsessed with WrestleMania), blood sausage, Sonny and Cher’s “I’ve  
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly.

Caught up in this Punxsutawney purgatory, it's not long before our man eventually tries to end it all by topping himself (electrification in the bath with a toaster, driving a car off a cliff with a groundhog for company - further proof this wasn't the groundhog's doing) but all to no avail, because, again, it’s all in his head. 
Groundhog Day sees Phil Connors get stuck in purgatory - but one interesting theory flips its happy ending to introduce another kind of hell. Groundhog Day's ending may be worse than it seems. Screen Rant

Jay Dysart is phenomenal in the lead, a Phil Connors with a more frenetic, brittle edge than the stillness of Murray’s film version. As the musical unfolds you watch his Connors spin through detached disbelief to detached hedonism to acceptance of his fate without ever feeling less attached to his arc.Repetition is an art of infinite variety as it’s practiced by Jay Dysart in GROUNDHOG DAY

“It’s like groundhog day meets purgatory.” The only other area in the Central Valley with worse subsidence is Delta-Mendota near Los Baños, Quinley said. But the Tule is sinking at such a rate, it will likely pass Delta-Mendota , making it the deepest area of subsidence in the nation. </p>
