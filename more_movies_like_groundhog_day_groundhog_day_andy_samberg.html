        <p>The Groundhog Day inspirations are obvious in this movie, but it feels fresh with how the time loop mechanic is used as a source of dark humor, cathartic change, and character development. Both Samberg and Milioti bring tons of fun and chemistry to their roles, making Palm Springs one of the most enjoyable in the genre. 
Why you'll like this movie: Happy Death Day cleverly combines horror, humor, and a time loop premise, creating a unique and thrilling counterpart to Groundhog Day. The protagonist's quest to solve her own murder within a repeating day mirrors Phil Connors' journey of self-improvement, balancing suspenseful mystery with comedic elements. Premise: 
While there have been plenty of time loop movies over the years, many have used the concept to dramatic effect, like in 12 Monkeys and Source Code.However, the classic 1990s comedy Groundhog Day helped popularize the time loop comedy subgenre in which a character is stuck reliving the same day over and over again until they figure out how to break the loop, leading to all kinds of hijinks as  
The Groundhog Day premise, though, injects a little hope into this wintry nihilism by arguing that more can be accomplished, but one must really push themselves (or accept life as it is) in order  
The classic 1993 movie stars Bill Murray as Phil Connors, a surly weatherman sent to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities in the tiny town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. Phil (who openly

Tree Glebman is Jess in this scenario, but while the latter functioned amidst a bleaker tone, the former revels in a more darkly comic and absurdist backdrop. 
This Groundhog Day, be sure to have movies like 'Palm Springs' and other time travel movies queued up to celebrate the holiday.  One of the more recent additions to the time loop genre,

Premiering only a few months after the release of Groundhog Day, this TV movie is a feature-length version of the much darker Oscar nominee, which was titled 12:01 PM (watch it on YouTube). Both

I really like the concept of the film, and I've seen a few other repeating-day movies but they are always pretty dark in tone and are more thriller then funny. That being said, are there any movies that share the same or a similar concept that are also cheery? 
I'm highly interested in movies with plot revolving around traveling back in time while retaining all your memories. Perfect example is movie Groundhog Day, repeating some time segment until you get the things right. On top of my head I can think about Back to the Future and Edge of Tomorrow. Do you know any similar movies? Thank you. 
At first, Harold Ramis’ GROUNDHOG DAY seems like a typical Bill Murray comedy with the iconic leading man standing one step away from the rest of humanity, always quick with an ironic insult. But the film cleverly turns Murray’s sarcastic outsider persona against him and the film evolves into a sweet fable about humanity. 
Great movie, especially if you like groundhog day.  Forgot about that one, I will have to rewatch it because I thought it was more like Moon than Groundhog Day  
Groundhog Day is easily my favorite movie, and my other favorite movies have a very similar feel. Hook with Robin Williams, and Yes Man with Jim Carrey are really good. It also helps when a funny person is the lead like Bill Murray.
