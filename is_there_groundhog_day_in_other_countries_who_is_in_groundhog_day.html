        <h2><strong>is there groundhog day in other countries happy groundhog day gift</strong></h2>
        <p>Groundhog Day is a widely celebrated tradition in North America, particularly in the United States and Canada. Every year on February 2nd, people eagerly await the emergence of a groundhog from its burrow to predict the arrival of spring. However, this unique holiday is not limited to just these two countries. 
The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
In Canada, Groundhog Day is also celebrated on February 2nd, and there are various noteworthy Groundhog Day festivities throughout the country. One of the most prominent Groundhog Day celebrations in Canada occurs in Wiarton, Ontario. 
So far, Phil has seen his shadow about 85% of the time. Canada's Groundhog Day relies on the predictions of an albino groundhog named Wiarton Willie. Although Punxsutawney Phil gets the most attention, various American cities have their own special groundhogs; New York City's official groundhog is called "Pothole Pete." 
The Groundhog Day ceremony in Punxsutawney is conducted in Pennsylvania Dutch, a dialect of German. Groundhog Day is also celebrated in other countries, such as Germany, where it is known as "Siebenschläfertag" or "Seven Sleepers Day." In Alaska, instead of a groundhog, they use a marmot to predict the weather on February 2nd. 
The US tradition of the groundhog Punxsutawney Phil emerging on 2 February to herald spring has fascinating origins – and creature parallels across Europe. 
February 2 is Groundhog Day in the U.S. and Canada, though probably everybody in the world knows about this weather-predicting custom since the movie “Groundhog Day” (“Und täglich grüßt das Murmeltier”) with Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell came out in 1993. But I would bet few know of the German origins of this weather lore day. 
Other countries may have their own variations of weather-related folklore and traditions, but Groundhog Day, as it is known, is not widely celebrated beyond North America. 3. The first official Groundhog Day was in 1887 
See how the groundhog became a symbol for predicting seasonal changes in America, rooted in German folklore with a badger — which in turn lead to Groundhog Day. 
Groundhog Day has been celebrated in the United States since at least February 2, 1886. Starting in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, with its now-famous groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, the tradition spread throughout America.

The movie was quite enjoyable. The tradition seems not that different than any other weather related superstition - I would guess there's something similar in every country. For example here we have 7 Brothers' Day (10th July) - if it rains on that day, it's supposedly rainy for 7 more weeks. 
Over the years, several other locations have begun using their own groundhog, including General Beauregard Lee of Atlanta, Dunkirk Dave of Dunkirk, New York, and Jimmy of Sun Prairie, Wisconsin. 
The Brief. Woodstock, Illinois, became the filming location for "Groundhog Day" (1993), and the town now celebrates the movie with an annual festival that attracts visitors from around the world. 
PUNXSUTAWNEY, Penn. - Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania is the Mecca for those around the country celebrating Groundhog Day. Every year, on Feb. 2, tens of thousands of people flock to this small town of  
This was exactly six weeks after February 2. Assuming that the equinox marked the first day of spring in certain medieval cultures, as it does now in Western countries, Groundhog Day occurred exactly six weeks before spring. Therefore, if the groundhog saw his shadow on Groundhog Day there would be six more weeks of winter.
