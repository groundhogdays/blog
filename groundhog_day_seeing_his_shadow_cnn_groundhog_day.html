        <p>When is Groundhog Day 2025? Groundhog Day will take place Sunday, Feb. 2, 2025.Thousands will show up in person, with the grounds to Gobblers Knob opening at 4 a.m., and millions will tune in to see if Punxsutawney Phil will see his shadow. 
The Groundhog sees no shadow: If he emerges from his burrow and does NOT see his shadow, then early spring weather is right around the corner. Perhaps the most famous groundhog is Punxsutawney Phil. 
The groundhog is known as Punxsutawney Phil, because the town where the Groundhog Day tradition originated is called Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. A big celebration is still held in the town to this  
However, if the groundhog does see his shadow, there will be six more weeks of winter rather than above average temperatures, according to legend. Forecast for 7 a.m. Sunday morning in  
Punxsutawney Phil is the best-known groundhog who has been making predictions since 1886, according to Punxsutawney Groundhog Club. The Groundhog Day tradition as we know it dates to 1887. 
Groundhog Day is famously connected to weather prediction, with the most prominent tradition involving a groundhog predicting the conclusion of winter by seeing (or not seeing) his own shadow. According to weather lore: Sees His Shadow: If the plump prognosticator emerges from his hole on a clear day and sees his shadow, he will retreat, and  
Prior to 2024, the groundhog had seen his shadow 107 times and not seen his shadow 20 times, according to the York Daily Record, part of the USA TODAY Network. There were a few years in the late  
For Groundhog Day in 2024, Punxsutawney Phil did not see his shadow, elating a massive crowd at Gobbler's Knob. 
The Punxsutawney Groundhog Club announced that Phil did not see his shadow at dawn on Friday. According to tradition, that means spring will arrive early this year. 2 February 2024 
Groundhog Day 2024: Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow and more winter Punxsutawney Phil predicts more winter ahead. Groundhogs may not have a great track record when it comes to weather forecasts  
Groundhog Day is almost here: What to know about the rodent, the shadow, and the weather Punxsutawney Phil is the most famous weather-predicting rodent, but he apparently isn't the most accurate. 
Here's when Groundhog Day began: The first mention of Groundhog Day came in 1886 in Punxsutawney. Over the years, several other locations have begun using their own groundhog, including General Beauregard Lee of Atlanta, Dunkirk Dave of Dunkirk, New York, and Jimmy of Sun Prairie, Wisconsin. 
Seeing his shadow is more likely. Punxsutawney Phil has seen his shadow about five times more often than he hasn't, based on historical records. However, last year did not fall in line with the norm. 
Phil's predictions of years past. Phil's first official shadow sighting came in 1887, followed by several years of no official recordings. His longest stretch of seeing his shadow is 21 years  
According to legend, if Phil sees his shadow, there will be six more weeks of winter. If he doesn’t see his shadow, you can expect an early spring. Phil will make his 2024 prediction around  
The focus of many was on Gobbler's Knob in tiny Pennsylvania town, Punxsutawney, on Friday, Feb. 2, 2024 as the weather prognosticating groundhog Phil sees, or doesn't see, his shadow. How did all  
Why is Groundhog Day celebrated every year on February 2? Groundhog Day is a beloved tradition for many as they wait to see how long winter will last. As the legend goes, if Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow, he predicts six more weeks of winter. If he doesn't, it's a forecast of an early spring. 
The Groundhog Day legend is simple: Punxsutawney Phil's shadow on Feb. 2 predicts the weather for the next 6 weeks until the start of spring.  A sunny day means the groundhog will see his  
Groundhog Day, Feb. 2, is coming up, and soon Punxsutawney Phil will tell us what to expect from the weeks to come. The holiday dates back hundreds of years, and has grown to be a widely  </p>
