As wonderful a movie as Groundhog Day is, it never explains the nature of Phil Connors (Bill Murray) being trapped in a time loop.  The Deleted Scene. This scene was deleted in the truest sense  
The Long Winter Edition reintegrates 5 deleted scenes, and 5 more minutes of footage, into the Bill Murray holiday classic! Intention: After seeing a few short deleted scenes on the Blu-Ray, I thought it would be benefical to see more of Phil's depressed period, while adding back 2 more good tasks on his final day in Punxsutawney. 
Funny and profound, Groundhog Day holds up on repeat viewing, allowing you to catch the jokes and sight gags you might have missed the first time. In honor of another Groundhog Day, I put together a list of the film’s 50 funniest moments, including an amusing bit that’s in one of the deleted scenes that didn’t make the final movie.

"Shocking unearthed Groundhog Day footage," Powell explains. Poor
