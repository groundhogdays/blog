This year, NOAA took a deeper dive into Groundhog Day results and graded the work of 19 groundhogs and groundhog surrogates to determine the accuracy of their predictions. Spoiler: Phil came in 17th. 
The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records.

Where does the phrase ‘Groundhog Day’ come from? 
"Groundhog Day is really a holiday about sex," he adds. Blumstein says all animals, not just the prognosticators, deserve respect. While some people consider groundhogs a nuisance because they like to snack on garden produce, he thinks living with urban and suburban wildlife is a good thing as it brings people closer to nature.
