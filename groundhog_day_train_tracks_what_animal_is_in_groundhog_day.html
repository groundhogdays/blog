PETA wants to cancel Groundhog Day and replace Pennsylvania's treasured Punxsutawney Phil tradition with a weather-reveal cake instead. 
Starring Bill Murray as Phil Connors, a cynical weatherman who finds himself reliving the same day over and over again, Groundhog Day mixes humor with philosophical themes.
