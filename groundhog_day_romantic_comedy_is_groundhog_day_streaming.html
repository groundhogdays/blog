It's a comedy with romantic elements, but the romance isn't the main focus. If you write a summary about this movie, you would say that this reporter is working on groundhog's day and mysteriously winds up in a time loop. 
In the 1993 romantic comedy Groundhog Day, Bill Murray stars as a disgruntled reporter who repeats the mundane holiday over and over again until he overcomes his narcissistic ways.

Exactly. I can still enjoy the movie for what it is. A funny and warm comedy. But when people pretend that Groundhog Day has a deep meaning or that we can learn something from it, I get a bit annoyed. If the movie was that serious, it would not stand up to a critical assessment. 
50 First Dates explores the challenge of love through repetition, with a protagonist who must make his love interest remember him afresh each day.
