        <p>Mystery Spot: Directed by Kim Manners. With Jared Padalecki, Jensen Ackles, Jim Beaver, Richard Speight Jr.. Sam relives the same day over and over, continually having to deal with Dean's death. 
Mystery Spot is the 11th episode of Season 3. It premiered on February 14th, 2008. Sam and Dean investigate the disappearance of a man who went missing at a tourist location. While searching the site, Dean is shot and killed by the owner. Sam is devastated but stunned when he wakes up the next morning to find Dean alive and well. As the day unfolds, Sam realizes he is re-living the previous  
Dean: Like Groundhog Day. Groundhog Day was a 1993 movie starring Bill Murray, where his character relives the same day over and over. Other references to Groundhog Day include Sam waking to the same song every morning, though in Groundhog Day the song is "I Got You Babe" by Sonny and Cher. 
Supernatural season 3 episode "Mystery Spot" is a perfect parody of Groundhog Day, especially with its use of Asia's "Heat Of The Moment." Supernatural arrived in 2005 and follows the Winchester brothers Dean (Jensen Ackles) and Sam (Jared Padalecki). 
Supernatural's "Groundhog Day" Can Explain Why Sam Never Brought Dean Back When Dean died at the end of the series, Sam didn’t try to bring him back, which was uncharacteristic of the brothers, but there’s an explanation for this in Supernatural season 3, “Mystery Spot.”

When Sam and Dean investigate the disappearance of a man who was looking into a tourist attraction known as "The Mystery Spot" -- where the laws of physics don't apply -- Sam is thrown into a repeating loop, living the same day over and over, and watching Dean die each time in a different way as Sam avoids the method that killed him the last time. 
Like "Groundhog Day". SAM Yes, exactly. Like "Groundhog Day". DEAN, nodding Uh-huh. SAM So you don't believe me. DEAN (laughs) It's just a little crazy, I mean even for us crazy, you know, like, uh— SAM Dingo ate my baby crazy? DEAN How'd you know I was going to say that? SAM Because you said it before, Dean, that's my whole point. DORIS 
The episode, which finds Sam stuck in a Groundhog Day-style time loop that resets after Dean dies, was a brilliant mixture of comedy, angst, and poignancy. By that point in the season, Dean had already made a deal with the crossroads demon to save Sam’s life in exchange for his soul and had sworn to his brother that he was okay with that

With a show like Supernatural - which reveled in pushing the envelope with odd and often meta episodes - there are more than just a couple. From playing themselves acting in the show Supernatural, to suffering through a Groundhog Day, and even getting animated and teaming up with Scooby-Doo, these are the strangest cases Sam and Dean ever worked. 
Really interesting take on the Groundhog Day principle, which ties in well with the Supernatural story as you see a change in Sam as he becomes more ruthless, determined and detached from others in trying to change Dean's fate. 
Considering Doctor Who is a show that is heavily reliant on the concept of time travel, it should come as no surprise that it has a Groundhog Day episode of its own. In “Heaven Sent,” the Doctor finds himself trapped in a remote castle on Gallifrey, where he’s relentlessly pursued by a terrifying creature known as the Veil, only to be reborn in a glass chamber every time he’s killed. 
In the episode 3.11 Mystery Spot Sam relives a Groundhog Day-like universe in which Dean dies every day under strange and inevitable circumstances. The color filter that usually darkens the picture and makes every Supernatural episode a bit grainier and bleak looking isn't used for most of the episode, but it comes back just when Zachariah

Groundhog Day has inspired numerous parodies and references in TV shows, including "The Simpsons," "Supernatural," and "Buffy the Vampire Slayer." The phrase "Groundhog Day" is now commonly used to describe a situation that feels endlessly repetitive. </p>
