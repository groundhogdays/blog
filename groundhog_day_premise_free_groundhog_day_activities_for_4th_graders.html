        <h2><strong>groundhog day premise song about groundhog day</strong></h2>
        <p>Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
For Connors, Groundhog Day begins each morning at 6:00 A.M., when he wakes up in his room in a Victorian bed and breakfast. His clock radio is always playing the same song, "I Got You Babe" by Sonny &amp; Cher. His memories of the "previous" day are intact, but he is trapped in a seemingly endless time loop, repeating the same day in the same small  
The premise of Groundhog Day (the movie) is brilliantly simple. Bill Murray plays weatherman Phil Connors, a sarcastic, egotistical narcissist who gets stuck in a time loop and is forced to relive Groundhog Day over and over until he learns to become a better human — causing his producer, Rita, played by Andie MacDowell, to fall in love with him. 
Groundhog Day: Directed by Harold Ramis. With Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliott, Stephen Tobolowsky. A narcissistic, self-centered weatherman finds himself in a time loop on Groundhog Day. 
The band Nine Inch Nails essentially took the premise of the film and turned it into a song that reads like a suicide note. Check out the lyrics below:  Groundhog Day was especially relevant  
“Groundhog Day” was directed and cowritten by Harold Ramis, Murray’s fellow Ghostbuster and a partner from their Second City days. The film is lovable and sweet. The film is lovable and sweet. If “Scrooged” seemed to reflect a dour discontent, this one is more optimistic about the human race, and the Murray character is likable by the  
The next day, Phil wakes up at six in the morning on February 2nd, Groundhog Day, which had already been yesterday. From that moment on, the awareness of the repeated day becomes solely Phil’s experience, as he watches in horror the same events unfold as the day before. No one, including Rita, believes his stories about the unexpectedly  
However, “Groundhog Day” popularized the premise in the 1990s, to the point that the film’s title is synonymous with the premise it utilizes. Since “Groundhog Day” gained fame, movies like “ Edge of Tomorrow ,” “ Happy Death Day ” and its sequel and “ Looper ” have all taken their own spins on the concept.. 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 comedy directed by Harold Ramis, starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell. It was written by Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis and based on a story by Rubin. In the film, Murray plays Phil Connors, an egocentric Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania TV weatherman who, during a hated assignment covering the annual Groundhog Day event (February 2) in Punxsutawney, finds himself repeating  
Groundhog Day is of course an ingenious premise: a jerk is stuck in a time loop forced to relive the same day over and over and over until he becomes a kind, generous man and finally understands love. It's a moral tale that will almost certainly stand the test of time.

The episode sees Zari stuck in an hour-long loop, after which the Waverider repeatedly explodes, killing everyone on board. Despite its high stakes though, “Here I Go Again” is a relatively breezy episode, using its Groundhog Day premise to learn more about the ship’s crew and set up some entertaining comedy bits. 
"Groundhog Day" Loop: This film is the Trope Namer by virtue of its basic premise of the film as Phil keeps looping back to February 2. This film also indirectly named the trope Groundhog Peggy Sue . 
Happy Death Day cleverly combines horror, humor, and a time loop premise, creating a unique and thrilling counterpart to Groundhog Day. The protagonist's quest to solve her own murder within a repeating day mirrors Phil Connors' journey of self-improvement, balancing suspenseful mystery with comedic elements. 
As successful as those movies are, they all owe a lot to the original time-loop gem, Groundhog Day. The comedy stars Bill Murray as a cranky weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day festival but finds himself waking up on the same day over and over.

It's Groundhog Day if it had been conceived as a sci-fi action movie instead of a romantic comedy.  The premise centres around the day repeating itself. 
I love Palm Springs even past the (early) point when you figure out how it’s built upon the Groundhog Day premise  it doesn’t feel like a copycat, just it’s own version, with some significant tonal differences that just make you appreciate both movies more. 
The Groundhog Day inspirations are obvious in this movie, but it feels fresh with how the time loop mechanic is used as a source of dark humor, cathartic change, and character development. Both Samberg and Milioti bring tons of fun and chemistry to their roles, making Palm Springs one of the most enjoyable in the genre. 
The premise of “Groundhog Day,” both the movie and the musical, is well-known: Cynical television weather forecaster Phil Connors, covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney
