        <p>There has been one year when the event was canceled (1943) due to World War II. [113] [114]  Groundhog Days Around the World; Official Punxsutawney Groundhog Club; 
Groundhog Day has been celebrated in the United States since at least February 2, 1886. Starting in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, with its now-famous groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, the tradition spread throughout America. It is now celebrated all over, and not just with groundhogs. 
It is uncertain how a groundhog got the role of predicting weather but Phil has been participating in Groundhog Day since 1886 and about 40 other Phil’s by our count.  There’s no Groundhog  
Deeley declined to share how many groundhog Phil’s there have been, but the average groundhog living in captivity can live up to 10 years, according to the University of Michigan’s Museum of  
The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The annual ritual has roots in pre-Christian traditions and was brought to the U.S. by  
Groundhog Day, in the United States and Canada, day (February 2) on which the emergence of the groundhog from its burrow is said to foretell the weather for the following six weeks. The beginning of February, which falls roughly halfway between the winter solstice and the spring equinox , has long been a significant time of the year in many  
There are also 10 Groundhog Days for which there is no record of what Phil saw.  There have been weather-predicting groundhogs in at least 28 U.S. states and Canadian provinces, and less formal  
The surprising history of Groundhog Day and Punxsutawney Phil's rise to fame goes back thousands of years.  She would have been allowed to worship in the temple again, so February 2 is also  
This tradition is said to have started in 1887, and has grown in popularity in the years since. The groundhog‘s popularity was given an even greater boost following the release of the 1993 Bill Murray movie Groundhog Day. 
The odds of having any precipitation at all on Groundhog Day is 51% (77 out of 151). There has been measurable (0.01" or greater) precipitation on 42 Groundhog Days (27.8%) and trace amounts (less than 0.01") of precipitation on 35 Groundhog Days (23.2%). Since 1893, it has snowed on 62 out of 127 (48.8%) Groundhog Days. 
How many Groundhog Days are actually in "Groundhog Day?" By Chris Taylor on February 2, 2021 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Flipboard 
In honor of Groundhog Day last week — when Punxsutawney Phil predicted an early spring (so we got that going for us [and, yes, I am mixing my Bill Murray movie references]) — Gallagher pinpointed the exact number of Groundhog Days Murray's Phil Connors endures in “Groundhog Day:” 12,403 days. 
A groundhog’s lifespan is normally 6 to 8 years. How many Punxsutawney Phils have there been? Answer: 
The Stormfax Almanac has made note of the weather conditions on each Groundhog Day since 1999; the almanac has recorded 12 incidents in a 20-year span in which the Inner Circle said the groundhog saw his shadow while the sky was cloudy or there was rain or snow coming down, and in one case said the groundhog did not see his shadow despite  
Counting down the days, hours, minutes and seconds until Groundhog Day  How many days until Groundhog Day? There are only 6 days to go.  They have either been  
How many days till; How many days till Groundhog Day? On 12-14-2024 there are 50 days till Groundhog Day. What weekday is Groundhog Day? Groundhog Day is on a Sunday , on February 2, 2025. 
The Duration Calculator calculates the number of days, months and years between two dates. 
This might be one of the greatest mysteries of cinema that has never truly been revealed.  his total to at least 12,395 days, assuming he mastered the piano, French poetry, and ice sculpting at  
There are 2 days until Groundhog Day. to go. All times are shown in  
Clarification: It's been estimated that 38 separate days were shown in the film, not that he "repeated Groundhog Day 38 times." The "calculated" time can't be referenced anymore though, that website is down so we have no idea where that number comes from. </p>
