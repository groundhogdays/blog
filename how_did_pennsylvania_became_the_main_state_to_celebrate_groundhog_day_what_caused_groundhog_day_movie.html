        <p>On Jan. 29, 2017, “The Guardians of Phil” premiered in Punxsutawney – a Discovery Channel documentary about Groundhog Day. In 2021, the Groundhog Club moved its operations from the town library to the Groundhog Visitor Center on the grounds of Gobbler’s Knob, complete with interactive displays and a gift shop featuring all sorts of  
Crowds as large as 30,000 have turned out to Punxsutawney for multi-day Groundhog Day festivities, which the state calls a significant tourism boost for the town of fewer than 6,000 people. 
February 2, 1886 - The Punxsutawney Spirit newspaper proclaims this date as Pennsylvania's first official Groundhog Day celebration. 1986 - Phil travels to Washington, DC to meet with President  
PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa. – Groundhog Day is on Feb. 2, but the yearly tradition of watching a groundhog one day a year is about much more than predicting the timeliness of spring. Punxsutawney Phil emerging from the ground is also about Americans seeing or not seeing the shadow of the oldest known indigenous tribe in the United States. 
Groundhog Day, is the day when a sleepy rodent, Punxsutawney Phil, is yanked from his hole to see if he can spot his shadow in the ultimate seasonal prognostication. The History of Groundhog Day While this is a holiday celebrated in various parts of the United States, many people may be unaware that this tradition has its roots in Pennsylvania  
What began as a tale from ancient times became fact in the early 1880’s, when a group of Punxsutawney residents decided to celebrate Candlemas Day by going to the woods in search of a groundhog. In 1886, the editor of the local newspaper named the group the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club . 
Since 1887, Groundhog Day has been an American celebration focused on a groundhog predicting the weather. Each year, thousands gather in Pennsylvania to experience the festivities. 
Crowds as large as 30,000 have turned out to Punxsutawney for multi-day Groundhog Day festivities, which the state calls a significant tourism boost for the town of fewer than 6,000 people. The ceremony itself — which returned to the stage in 2022 after a COVID-19 hiatus — features dancers, music, speeches and visitors from around the world. 
Groundhog Day fans aren’t able to arrive at the official “Gobbler’s Knob” grounds until they open at 3 a.m. ET. Since the holiday has evolved over time, Groundhog Day activities don’t just end after Phil makes his predictions. In fact, celebratory events continue throughout the rest of the week — including the Groundhog Ball on Feb. 3. 
The Groundhog Day tradition came to North America from German settlers in Pennsylvania. The celebration dates back to Candlemas Day , a Christian holiday observed on February 2nd. 
Every year on February 2, crowds gather at Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to watch a groundhog emerge for the day—just like in the classic Bill Murray film Groundhog Day. You

The Pennsylvania Groundhog Club claims that Phil is 132 years old and that he “gets his longevity from drinking ‘groundhog punch.’” We’re happy to know that German settlers brought both a fun tradition and the secret of longevity to the United States! Happy Groundhog Day. By Nicole Glass, German Embassy 
Groundhog Day is perhaps one of the Pennsylvania Dutch community's most well-known cultural inventions – although the Amish themselves do not celebrate it, since it is not a religious holiday. 
Little did/do most kids today know that a woodchuck is a groundhog, or that in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, on Feb. 2, 1887, a groundhog came out of its hole at Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney and  
It celebrates Jesus being taken into the Temple of Jerusalem 40 days after his birth. It is still widely celebrated across Europe and in some South American countries, but in North America it’s almost never heard of. That’s because here in the United States and Canada February 2nd – the date of Candlemas – has become something else  
The movie "Groundhog Day" has become a cultural phenomenon, often referenced in discussions about time loops and repetitive events. The film was added to the United States National Film Registry in 2006 for being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant." 
Crowds as large as 30,000 have turned out to Punxsutawney for multi-day Groundhog Day festivities, which the state calls a significant tourism boost for the town of fewer than 6,000 people. 
Today all across the US and Canada, many communities celebrate their own version of Groundhog Day. In Canada alone, there are a half dozen places with a Groundhog Day tradition. In French Canada the day is called Jour de la marmotte. “Fred la marmotte of Val-d’Espoir” has been the winter forecaster for the province of Quebec since 2009. 
On February 2, 1887, Groundhog Day, featuring a rodent meteorologist, is celebrated for the first time at Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania.According to tradition, if a groundhog  </p>
