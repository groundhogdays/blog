        <p>The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a

Other towns have their own groundhog mascots, such as Wiarton Willie in Wiarton, Ontario, and General Beauregard Lee in Georgia. Groundhog Day events often include music, food, and games, making it a fun-filled day for families. Some schools and communities hold educational programs to teach children about groundhogs and the history of  
The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The annual ritual has roots in pre-Christian traditions and was brought to the U.S. by  
Groundhog Day, in the United States and Canada, day (February 2) on which the emergence of the groundhog from its burrow is said to foretell the weather for the following six weeks. The beginning of February, which falls roughly halfway between the winter solstice and the spring equinox , has long been a significant time of the year in many  
PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa. -- Here's a look at Groundhog Day, an American tradition that is meant to predict when spring will arrive. Facts. The groundhog emerges from its burrow on February 2. If the  
In 1993, the film Groundhog Day starring Bill Murray popularised the use of the term ‘groundhog day’ to mean something that is endlessly repeated.It also popularised the event itself: after the film came out, the crowd at Gobbler’s Knob grew from around 2,000 annual attendees to a staggering 40,000, which is nearly 8 times the population of Punxsutawney. 
Groundhog Day, Feb. 2, is coming up, and soon Punxsutawney Phil will tell us what to expect from the weeks to come. The holiday dates back hundreds of years, and has grown to be a widely  
The History of Groundhog Day. The Christian religious holiday of Candlemas Day has become most commonly associated with the current celebration, but it’s roots are older than that. The celebration started in Christianity as the day, (February 2nd), when Christians would take their candles to the church to have them blessed. 
Because there were no hedgehogs in the area, according to The Punxsutawney Club website, the Germans decided that it was time for the groundhog’s day in the sun (pun intended). Many years later, and we’re still looking to Punxsutawney, and, of course, its top groundhog, Phil, to indicate whether or not we should bundle up or pack away the  
I was going to comment about maybe he's becoming a master bartender, much like how Phil went around mastering different things in his time there. Then I realized that in the 10,000 years Phil was stuck, the bartender would have to avoid Phil at all times, since Phil would quickly realize that something was wrong if he saw the bartender where he  
The Punxsutawney groundhog makes predictions, but he’s not always predictable. The designated groundhog emerged before sunrise in 1929 and didn’t come out until late afternoon in 1941. 
According to Groundhog Day organizers, the rodents' forecasts are accurate 75% to 90% of the time. However, a Canadian study for 13 cities in the past 30 to 40 years found that the weather patterns predicted on Groundhog Day were only 37% accurate over that time period—a value not significant compared to the 33% that could occur by chance. 
Groundhog Day casts a long shadow (no pun intended), to the point where the recent Sundance film Before I Fall, which also features time loops, was careful to make it plain they were not inspired by Groundhog Day. But there's no shame in taking inspiration from one of the most interesting and deceptively rich films ever made in Hollywood. 
Groundhog Day, in the United States and Canada, day (February 2) on which the emergence of the groundhog from its burrow is said to foretell the weather for the following six weeks. In the United States the most popular event occurs in Pennsylvania and centers on a groundhog designated Punxsutawney Phil. 
There is no cause given for the curse nor is a reason given for why it stops at the end of the film. The holiday he is trapped in is “Groundhog Day” – a curious holiday which I’ll be decoding later in the post. Because make no mistake, comms build off each other. The comm of “Groundhog day” utilizes an established comm to send its own. 
Groundhog Day is real, in the sense that there is a real holiday and there is a real ceremony. Whether or not the groundhog sees his shadow has no actual bearing on how much longer winter weather lasts, but it's a fun tradition. It has yet to be proven whether Bill Murray actually spent 
Since the 1800s, Groundhog Day has been observed on Feb. 2. The longstanding tradition calls for groundhogs to tell us if spring is near. 
[Groundhog Day] Ned Ryerson is the devil, and he imprisons Phil Conners in the time loop when Phil refuses to purchase Ned's insurance. The only way Phil escapes is by finally agreeing to buy it. 
But it is also possible that Day n comes to an end at, say, 3:10, and there is no supertime between 3:10 of one Day and 5:59 of the next, so that things go directly from 3.10 to 5.59. Or perhaps supertime runs on with nothing happening in any local time until 5:59. </p>
