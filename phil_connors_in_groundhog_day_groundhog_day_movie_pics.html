Groundhog Day follows Bill Murray’s character, Phil Connors, a TV weatherman who becomes mysteriously trapped in a time loop during a reporting trip to Punxataney, PA, for the town’s annual  
The premise of Groundhog Day (the movie) is brilliantly simple. Bill Murray plays weatherman Phil Connors, a sarcastic, egotistical narcissist who gets stuck in a time loop and is forced to relive  
Analysis of Phil Connors' Transformation Phil's Initial State.

He leads a life characterized by narcissism and self-righteousness, with little regard for others or their feelings. 
Phil Connors : This is pitiful. A thousand people freezing their butts off waiting to worship a rat. What a hype. Groundhog Day used to mean something in this town. They used to pull the hog out, and they used to eat it. You're hypocrites, all of you!

Phil Connors is the main protagonist of the movie Groundhog Day. He starts off as an arrogant jerk with little to no heroic qualities who remains this way until after somehow being forced to repeat Groundhog Day for several years. While even then he starts out as very self-centred, manipulative and hedonistic, over time, he gradually becomes much more selfless and starts helping people out of

Directed by Harold Ramis and co-written by Danny Rubin, Groundhog Day follows a cynical weatherman (Murray) who finds himself stuck in Punxsutawney  
Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is an arrogant Pittsburg weatherman who looks down on everyone around him and treats his coworkers poorly. His least favorite part of the year is when the network sends him to cover Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, so when he finds he's stuck in an endlessly repeating Groundhog Day, it's a living nightmare. 
Groundhog Day Plot Summary. The film centers around the quirky festivities of Groundhog Day on February 2nd in Punxsutawney, starring Bill Murray as Phil Connors and Andy MacDowell as Rita. It’s a delightful blend of satire, comedy, and just a dash of romance. 
Fun facts about Groundhog Day (1993): As Murray’s character evolved to be a much better human being, when director Harold Ramis’ would explain a scene, Murry would simply ask “Good Phil or Bad Phil?” so he knew what direction to take with the scene. 
Phil Connors? Phil Connors, I thought that was you! Phil: Hi, how are you doing? Thanks for watching.  Groundhog Day, the 1993 film Ramis directed and co-wrote  
Groundhog Day celebrations went from seeing about 5,000 spectators every year to somewhere around 35,000, President of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, Tom Dunkel, explained to WTAJ. “I would say it was the catalyst that put Punxsutawney Phil from having 5,000 people come for Groundhog Day to having 35,000 people come for Groundhog Day. That  
Phil Connors (Murray), an arrogant and smarmy weatherman for a local TV news station in Pittsburgh, his new producer Rita Hanson (Andie MacDowell), and cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott) go to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania to film the annual Groundhog Day festival. Phil loathes the annual celebration and is surly throughout the proceedings, wanting  
In one of his finest roles, Bill Murray plays sarcastic and arrogant Pittsburgh weather forecaster Phil Connors in Harold Ramis' 1993 masterpiece, Groundhog Day.Phil believes that he's destined  
Still, it’s perfectly sensible to wonder what happened to Phil Connors after his years of endless Groundhog Days. Phil experienced thousands of February 2nds, learned to be a better man, then

Murray portrays Phil Connors, a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2nd repeatedly. It was  
This type of moral redemption is portrayed in a most poignant way in Groundhog Day, a movie released in 1993 starring Bill Murray and produced by Harold Ramis. In Groundhog Day, the lead character Phil Connors is a television weatherman who is arrogant, nasty, and utterly self-absorbed. Connors spends February 2nd covering the Groundhog Day  
Bill Murray's role as Phil Connors in 1993's Groundhog Day is one for the ages, especially considering he hated his experience behind-the-scenes just as much as his character did onscreen! Despite
