        <h2><strong>christmas movie like groundhog day utah groundhog day 2025</strong></h2>
        <p>Why you'll like this movie: Christmas Do-Over brings the time loop concept to the holiday season, with a protagonist reliving Christmas Day repeatedly. The film's focus on personal redemption and improving relationships within a repetitive cycle captures the heartwarming journey seen in Groundhog Day, with a festive twist. Premise: 
The Groundhog Day inspirations are obvious in this movie, but it feels fresh with how the time loop mechanic is used as a source of dark humor, cathartic change, and character development. Both Samberg and Milioti bring tons of fun and chemistry to their roles, making Palm Springs one of the most enjoyable in the genre. 
While there have been plenty of time loop movies over the years, many have used the concept to dramatic effect, like in 12 Monkeys and Source Code.However, the classic 1990s comedy Groundhog Day helped popularize the time loop comedy subgenre in which a character is stuck reliving the same day over and over again until they figure out how to break the loop, leading to all kinds of hijinks as  
You can stream some of these movies like Groundhog Day on Netflix, Amazon Prime or Hulu. 12. 12 Dates of Christmas (2011) Probably the most low key movie on the list, ’12 Dates of Christma’ refers to the timeline for Kate, a young, ambitious woman, who perseveres to maintain healthy relationships in her life. 
Kevin tries to be involved with his son and ex-wife's family for Christmas. During dinner, he thought his Christmas *day* couldn't be more screwed; his son suddenly wishes it was Christmas every day. After that, it was a regular Groundhog's Day. Kevin learns new dance moves and can actually sing. Don't let the caroling fool you. 
The classic 1993 movie stars Bill Murray as Phil Connors, a surly weatherman sent to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities in the tiny town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. Phil (who openly  
Premiering only a few months after the release of Groundhog Day, this TV movie is a feature-length  William Dean Howells’s 1892 short story Christmas Every Day.  out like a straight horror  
Some dabble with the idea of goodwill toward men, others not at all, but every year you’ll likely see at least a few in the post-Christmas day TV listings. Santa won’t be climbing down any chimneys here (well, not without swearing). 1. Groundhog Day. This isn’t set around Christmas time but on February 2nd, or Groundhog Day. 
Bill Murray repeating the same day over and over is certainly unique, but here are 12 movies like "Groundhog Day" we think you should check out. 
Harold Ramis’ 1993 classic Groundhog Day is simply one of the most perfect movies ever made; Bill Murray’s snarky sense-of-humor has never been more endearing, and Ramis’ script is both  
Christmas Do-Over: Directed by Catherine Cyran. With Jay Mohr, Daphne Zuniga, David Millbern, Adrienne Barbeau. Kevin tries to be involved with his son and ex-wife's family for Christmas. 
12 Dates of Christmas is a festive version of Groundhog Day with maybe a bit of A Christmas Carol thrown in. Amy Smart is reliving her Christmas Eve as she wakes up each time on the floor of a department store. She is selfish, self obsessed and rude. 
Not exactly about reliving a day, but time travel: Timecrimes (2007). It's not wholesome tho. Also Predestination (2014), about time travel Edit: Source Code (2011)! This one actually does have the "repete the same event" formula. All of these are more action/sci-fi, not about life lessons like Groundhog Day 
Now, obviously, a time loop movie is a great premise for horror flicks or sci-fi thrillers. But if you like the slice-of-life or comedy aspect of Groundhog Day then the next movie is something you can try out. This movie may not be for everyone because as you can guess from the title it is a Christmas movie. 
You can stream some of these movies like Groundhog Day on Netflix, Amazon Prime or Hulu. 12. 12 Dates of Christmas (2011) Probably the most low key movie on the list, ’12 Dates of Christma’ refers to the timeline for Kate, a young, ambitious woman, who perseveres to maintain healthy relationships in her life. 
"Groundhog Day" Loop: A wish to have Christmas again places Ro in a time loop where she experiences Christmas Day over and over. It's All About Me : Ro, naturally for this story, is only concerned with how her Christmas is going because she wants it to be like on her bucket list and exploits the looping Christmas to do whatever she wants. 
It's Groundhog Day drunk on rancid eggnog. The made-for-TV Christmas-movie cottage industry has begun plopping its sugar plums into your streaming menus, and Christmas on Repeat (now on Hulu) is  
What do you get it you take a classic movie like the 1993 movie "Groundhog Day", spice it up with Christmas and add a pinch of Disney magic? Well, you get "Christmas Again". Yeah, that was essentially all that could be required to summarize this 2021 Christmas movie. 
The first time I saw "Groundhog Day" I was reminded of a short film called "1201 pm" that I'd seen late one night when I was a teenager. It stars Kurtwood Smith. It's pretty good, they tried to make a feature film later on but I hear it's a turkey, I think the guy who wrote and directed the short also tried to sue the studio that made GD.
