        <p>PUNXSUTAWNEY, PA - FEBRUARY 02: Groundhog Punxsutawney Phil climbs on the top hat of his handler after Phil did not see his shadow and predicting an early spring during the 127th Groundhog Day  
Groundhog day is one of my favorite films, even after my most recent rewatch. One of the things that I hate about this film however is the ending. Specifically Phil's last day in the time-loop. 
Not only is 1993's Groundhog Day considered one of Bill Murray's best films ever, but it's also widely regarded as one of the finest comedies to come out of the 1990s. It's the perfect blend of  
It's silly to dislike a day so much, but I really do. It grates on my nerves a little more every year. When I was a kid, I used to get all excited about it, because there was something neat about a groundhog who could basically predict the future. Now, however, I hate Groundhog day a little more every year, and here are 7 of the reasons why. 
One of the most treasured roles of his career is playing disgruntled weatherman Phil Connors in the cult classic 1993 film Groundhog Day. In the movie, Phil is forced to relive Feb. 2 in  
The Punxsutawney Groundhog Club also states that in Phil’s free time he likes to, “enjoy a good book and read the daily newspaper.” Disgusting. While it may seem incredibly harsh to say that I hate a soft, cuddly, adorable little groundhog, I absolutely do, and nothing will change my mind. 
On a lighter but more tragic note, do you have any regrets about dropping the groundhog in 2014? ﻿ Yeah. 100 percent. I’m like, “Don’t make me hold a fucking groundhog.” I mean, what the hell? Let me tell you exactly what happened. Please. ﻿ I go there and it’s seven in the morning, which means my motor skills are not at their best. 
However, PETA -- the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals -- wants to cancel Groundhog Day. Instead, they'd like to replace Pennsylvania's treasured Punxsutawney Phil tradition with a  
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
Groundhog Day has been celebrated in the U.S. since 1887. Thousands of observers flock to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, every year on Feb. 2 to see Phil predict the weather. 
Watched Palm Springs last night and really enjoyed it, the fact that both protagonists remember the loop day adds to the intimacy and journey (IIRC only bill Murray’s character has memory in Groundhog Day?). An enjoyable 90 minutes. 
Groundhog Club handler A.J. Dereume holds Punxsutawney Phil, the weather prognosticating groundhog, during the 137th celebration of Groundhog Day on Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pa., Feb. 2  
The guy, at a minimum spent like 30 years in a loop and before the loop he was like what, 50? Every day doing the same thing for 30 years, I wouldn't be surprised if he can't remember the first day or the day before or his colleagues names at work. 
Groundhog Day is dumb. Here's why.HEY! I'm on SnapChat now: wheezywaiterSign up for the WheezeMail email list? Social WeezdiaTumbl 
I hate the Lays "Groundhog Day" commercials The new lays commerical that started airing after the Superbowl are so annoying. I mean hell even the actor in the commercial is annoyed by the commercial 
I HATE GROUNDHOG DAY. Quiz introduction.  march 22nd is a very special day! Take later. 1.7K Takers Personality Quiz. 1.7K Takers. what kind of pigeon are you  
I f*cking hate Groundhog day. I hate the entire idea that we should all swallow our common sense for 1 day a year because someone, somewhere thinks groundhogs are cute. I got news for you, you seeker of amorous rodent delights, wherever the f*ck you are, groundhogs ain't cute. 
Joe Greeley here, for Nimlok Minnesota. Here’s what’s on my mind – Groundhog Day. Now don’t worry, I don’t mean the fuzzy varmint. And I don’t mean more winter or more spring or anything like that. What I am here to talk about though is Groundhog Day, the movie. The [] 
In the American tradition of Groundhog Day, the nation’s groundhog prognosticators take a stance on the season ahead. If the groundhog sees his shadow, he predicts six more weeks of winter. 
I Hate Groundhog Day Not the movie but the annual event where they pull some huge rodent from his nice comfy cage to have him do what he cannot - PREDICT THE FREAKING WEATHER. I want to scream at the TV each and every year. </p>
