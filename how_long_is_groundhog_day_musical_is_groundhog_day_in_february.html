Caught in a time loop, he’s forced to relive the same day again and again and again.

Article content. Nearly three decades after its premiere, the 1993 movie Groundhog Day has reached a new level of relevance under COVID-19. The world’s locked-down, working-from-home millions  
Opening Night of Groundhog Day: The Musical was a highly anticipated event for me. I am a huge Tim Minchin fan and was excited to see how his satirical comedic wit and mind-blowing musical ability would transform the popular 1990s movie through the addition of his music and lyrics. 
Groundhog Day is making its long clamoured for return to London’s Old Vic theatre in summer 2023.  “Groundhog Day: the Musical is an instant classic – and

Seven years later, Groundhog Day is making its triumphant return to the Old Vic, with Karl reprising his award-winning role.

Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years. Deezen noted that the second draft of the screenplay called for Phil to be cursed to live the time loop for 10,000 years. In the DVD commentary, Ramis estimated a real-time duration of 10 years. 
Landmark is thrilled to announce that tickets are now on sale for Groundhog Day: The Musical, opening November 1 and running for 3 weekends until November 17. 
I think Phil would've gone utterly insane in 10,000 years living the same day. Plus I think he would've had a much bigger reaction when it finally ended because it would be a massive shock to suddenly move to the next day after 10,000 years. You wouldn't even remember how things were prior to "groundhog day".
