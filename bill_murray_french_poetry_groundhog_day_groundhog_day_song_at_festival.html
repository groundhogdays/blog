        <p>The pronunciation is mostly wrong and the words are mumbled. Maybe it sounds French enough to fool the director and the producers of the movie But not me. P. P.-S. And it’s not old French poetry, the poem is inspired by the song La bourrée du célibataire by Jacques Brel (translated as Bachelor’s Dance). « La fille que j’aimera » is  
The movie is about a guy named Phil, played by Bill Murray, who is living the same day over and over again. In the scene below, Phil’s co-worker Rita, played by Andie McDowell, recites a few lines of poetry in response to Phil’s narcissistic persona. Here are the lines that precede the ones she recites: High though his titles, proud his name,

Erin: Well, maybe we can end with I found a translation of what Bill Murray says or tries to say in French (his pronunciation isn’t that good) the day after she’s revealed that she likes 19th century French poetry, and then he does his little quoting of a poem. Wes: Right. It’s not a poem. Erin: It’s not a poem. 
The poem Phil quoted to Rita was actually not 16th-century French poetry, but rather a song by Jacques Brel called La bourrée du célibataire (Bachelor's Dance). I had trouble finding translated lyrics, other than this from wikipedia: "The girl I will love is like a fine wine that gets a little better every morning." 
How many times did Bill Murray relive Groundhog Day?  10,000 hours to master any one subject which brings his total to at least 12,395 days, assuming he mastered the piano, French poetry, and  
My favourite part: Rita (Andie MacDowell) tells Phil (Bill Murray) that she studied 19th-century French poetry. The first time she says it, he laughs at her -- "Really? What a waste of time." -- and she recoils, not a little disgusted with his philistinism. 
A correspondent who found this page in 2003 asked me a question I never considered before; when Bill Murray starts spouting French to Andy McDowell in the restaurant, what is he saying? On April 11, 2004, Screenwriter Danny Rubin was kind enough to supply the words and a translation (without vouching for the French spelling): 
Groundhog Day (1993) Bill Murray as Phil.  You're a sucker for French poetry and rhinestones. You're very generous. You're kind to strangers and children, and when  
Groundhog Day - French Poetry: Phil (Bill Murray) impresses Rita (Andie MacDowell) at the end of a series of deja vu dates by consuming increasing knowledge  
OF COURSE I do not own this. Just thought it was cool. 
24 facts you never knew about Bill Murray’s greatest movie Groundhog Day Olivia Waring.  20. The French poem Bill recites in the pub is from this Jacques Brel song – rather than a 19th  
Did you know that Groundhog Day is Bill Murray‘s 8th highest-grossing film?After all, this 1993 movie earned about $71 million since its original release. Its premise is simple — Murray plays a weatherman, named Phil Connors, that becomes trapped in a time loop on Groundhog Day. 
The French poem that Phil recites in the German restaurant was written by the film’s co-writer Danny Rubin , based on the lyrics of Jacques Brel ‘s “Bachelor’s Dance”. Can Bill Murray speak French? Bill Murray Learned to Speak French, Play Piano, AND Carve Ice Sculptures! What time does the alarm clock go off in Groundhog Day? 
We see him relive Groundhog Day 38 times in the movie while another 414 days were mentioned in the film. Whatculture.com then used the theory that it takes 10,000 hours to master any one subject which brings his total to at least 12,395 days, assuming he mastered the piano, French poetry, and ice sculpting at different times. 
What French Poem Does Bill Murray Recite In Groundhog Day? A 1957 Jacques Brel song, “La bourrée du célibataire” or “Bachelor’s Dance” is cited as the inspiration for Phil’s French recital in a German restaurant. 
The Brief. Woodstock, Illinois, became the filming location for "Groundhog Day" (1993), and the town now celebrates the movie with an annual festival that attracts visitors from around the world. 
1. Watch Groundhog Day—and Live It Like Bill Murray! Let’s be honest: Groundhog Day (the movie) is as synonymous with the holiday as the actual groundhog. Bill Murray’s comedic performance as Phil Connors, the grumpy weatherman trapped in a time loop, has become a classic. </p>
