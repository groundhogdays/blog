This year is also the 25th anniversary of the movie "Groundhog Day." (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "GROUNDHOG DAY") MURRAY: (As Phil) A thousand people freezing their butts off, waiting to worship a rat. 
Here's the philosophy behind this classic comedy. There's nothing better for character development than spending 10,000 years trapped in a time loop  Groundhog Day,  One of the most  
More importantly for this conversation, however, is that the holiday is associated with a certain 1993 Bill Murray movie. Groundhog Day is considered one of the better comedies of the last few

The first draft of the screenplay for the movie, published in Rubin’s 2012 book “How to Write Groundhog Day,” included scenes with a Catholic priest and a street preacher. 
Groundhog Day is observed on February 2, according to the local legend, a day when the groundhog comes out of hibernation, and the locals determine the season change following this event. “ [I]f the groundhog wakes and sees his shadow, we’ve got six more weeks of winter to look forward to,” Connors explains. 
The Movie: Groundhog Day. Groundhog Day, the 1993 movie with Bill Murray, has become an icon in popular culture. In the Movie, Bill Murray plays Phil Connors, an obnoxious, self-centered news weatherman. 
Groundhog day with Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell is on many peoples Top 10 favorite movies of all time. But who knew that the movie has deep philosophical and Christian themes – in fact, it is a very Catholic. The Theology of Groundhog Day The movie stars Bill Murray as Phil–a weatherman who finds himself re-living a single day of his life–Groundhog Day. If you haven’t seen the movie  
Harold Ramis’ 1993 movie “Groundhog Day” is so entertaining, you’ll want to see it again, and again, and again. Explore meanings and central themes in the movie. 
The 1993 film Groundhog Day features egotistical weatherman Phil Connors, played by Bill Murray, reliving the same day over and over. While the movie is beloved as a comedy, many religious scholars consider it an “underground Buddhist classic” for its depiction of the cycle of death and rebirth. 
The movie’s twist comes on February 2. Phil wakes up at 6:00 a.m.  Groundhog Day is a thoroughly entertaining comedy,  Life and the events we’re presented have meaning. They are teachers  
The town was also the same location where the original movie was shot. But it also almost didn’t happen. Francois realized last fall that the Super Bowl and Groundhog Day would be occurring on the same day for only the second time in 54 years. He then had an idea for a Big Game ad that would recreate the movie, and wanted to cast Murray. 
Interpretations of this central mystery vary. But central to all is a morally complicated and powerful story arc to the main character. When Phil Connors arrives in Punxsutawney, he’s a perfect  
Groundhog’s Day is an iconic movie. I love to watch it for all the funny moments in movie. However, there is a much deeper meaning to the movie. The movie al 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
Therefore for Groundhog Day the curse of a single repeating day symbolized the 2,922 days that Bill Clinton would be in control of the most powerful levers of power in the world. This is why the song that plays each morning is “ I got you ” And just like the other media I decoded, the film is an appeal for people to flip to 666. 
Even in the 1990s, "Groundhog Day" was preceded by the Oscar-nominated short movie, "12:01 PM," and the "Star Trek: The Next Generation" season five episode, "Cause and Effect," which aired in 1992. 
In many ways, the themes of the "Groundhog Day" movie mirror the enduring appeal of the tradition itself. Just as Bill Murray‘s character learns to find meaning and purpose in the repetition of his daily life, so too do we find comfort and joy in the familiar rituals of Groundhog Day, year after year. Conclusion 
One aspect of the movie Groundhog Day could be described as an exploration of the true meaning of education. At first, when Phil realises that he has an infinite amount of time to play with, he teaches himself things for superficial ends; how to get rich, how to impress women, how to play games with people.
