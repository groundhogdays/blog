        <p>The crucial element was that he had to become such a good person that Rita could 'fall in love' with him in a single day I put 'fall in love' in inverted commas since she might just have been fond of him, but it seemed she was the crucial 'loop breaking' element. +1 for the answer. 
At the end of Groundhog Day, Phil Connors learns to use the time he has to enhance his life and use his abilities to help others, making him a popular figure in Punxsutawney, finally winning the heart of Rita, and breaking the endless repeating loop of Groundhog Day. 
The 1993 Harold Ramis comedy "Groundhog Day" may not have spawned the hero-caught-in-a-time-loop genre,  then by the hope he can break free from the loop, and finally by the desire to turn his  
The timeloop acted as a purgatory. It was an act of divine intervention to trap him until he learned what he was doing wrong with his life so that he could bring himself to experience heaven. It's possible that he died in the blizzard on the first day of the loop, but it might have also been an earthly miracle - he'll never really know. 
The old homeless man is in poor health, so Phil takes him to the hospital. Unfortunately, the old man dies at the hospital, but Phil tries to save him again the next day. Does Phil manage to break the time loop? This experience humbles Phil, and the next Groundhog Day morning, he gives a heartfelt speech during his reporting, impressing Rita. 
No, Groundhog Day is not based on a true story. It is a work of fiction written by Danny Rubin. 2. How many times does Phil Connors repeat Groundhog Day? Although it is never explicitly mentioned, it is estimated that Phil repeats Groundhog Day for approximately 10,000 days. 3. Does Phil Connors remember each day he repeats? 
Responsible for popularising a unique genre, Groundhog Day stars Murray as Phil Connors – an insufferable, cynical TV weather reporter who travels to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to cover an annual spectacle. However, he finds himself trapped in a seemingly endless time loop where he is forced to live the same day over and over again. 
The cause and end of the time loop in Groundhog Day (1993) What caused the time loop of Groundhog Day (1993) is the cynicism of Phil Connors and the weather storm he wrongly predicted that trapped him and his coworkers in the town of Punxsutawney, Philadelphia. Phil Connors constantly relives the same day and experiences highs and lows while  
Then in March 1985, he contracted a virus that attacked regions of his brain, causing a unique and profound form of amnesia. He was able to play complex piano scores, yet his episodic memory lasted 7 to 30 seconds. In short, he was stuck in a strange and maddening time loop. 
Phil's character arc and transformation, as well as gaining Rita's approval, are what ultimately bring an end to the time loop. At the end of Groundhog Day, Phil Connors learns to use the time he has to enhance his life and use his abilities to help others, making him a popular figure in Punxsutawney, finally winning the heart of Rita, and  
Punxsutawney Phil controls the time loop. The Seer of Seers and Prognosticator of Prognosticators was deeply offended when Connors called him a "large squirrel predicting the weather." Phil isn't a squirrel and he isn't predicting shit. He's a motherfucking groundhog and he decides when the seasons change. 
The episode "Groundmouse Day" has Brain repeatedly trying to take over the world by co-opting a Groundhog Day ceremony, while stuck in a time loop, in a parody of Groundhog Day. Stephen Tobolowsky, who played Ned in the film, plays the radio DJ in this episode.

Groundhog Day follows Bill Murray’s character, Phil Connors, a TV weatherman who becomes mysteriously trapped in a time loop during a reporting trip to Punxataney, PA, for the town’s annual  
After begrudgingly waking to the same day after his suicide, he becomes even more suicidal. He commits suicide, immediately waking at the infamous 6:00 a.m. several times throughout the next few days. 
In fact, the term "Groundhog Day" has become synonymous with both the phenomenon and the film trope of someone reliving the same day over and over in other movies like Groundhog Day. The film may be iconic for its brilliant utilization of the premise, but Groundhog Day 's ending still leaves many questions unanswered, including the exact number  
Considering all this, we could say that ‘Palm Springs’ does give a few nods to the timeless classic, but does not entirely depend on its tricks and techniques to save the day for itself. It has enough material of its own to not just stand on its feet but also to distinguish itself from ‘Groundhog Day’ and others similar films. 
He's a motherfucking groundhog and he decides when the seasons change. To punish Connors for his hubris, Punxsutawney Phil summoned a freak storm to trap him in his domain, then looped time until Connors learned his lesson. Remember, it's not until Phil Connors delivers his sincere monologue on the beauty of Groundhog Day that his curse is lifted. 
The premise of Groundhog Day (the movie) is brilliantly simple. Bill Murray plays weatherman Phil Connors, a sarcastic, egotistical narcissist who gets stuck in a time loop and is forced to relive  
Thankfully for Murray, his time on the set of Groundhog Day was much shorter than the time his character spent trapped in the movie's time-loop. Groundhog Day follows TV meteorologist Connors, who  </p>
