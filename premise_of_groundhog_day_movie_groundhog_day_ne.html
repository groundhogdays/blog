        <h2><strong>premise of groundhog day movie groundhog day for third grade</strong></h2>
        <p>Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
For Connors, Groundhog Day begins each morning at 6:00 A.M., when he wakes up in his room in a Victorian bed and breakfast. His clock radio is always playing the same song, "I Got You Babe" by Sonny &amp; Cher. His memories of the "previous" day are intact, but he is trapped in a seemingly endless time loop, repeating the same day in the same small  
Groundhog Day: Directed by Harold Ramis. With Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliott, Stephen Tobolowsky. A narcissistic, self-centered weatherman finds himself in a time loop on Groundhog Day. 
The premise of Groundhog Day (the movie) is brilliantly simple. Bill Murray plays weatherman Phil Connors, a sarcastic, egotistical narcissist who gets stuck in a time loop and is forced to relive Groundhog Day over and over until he learns to become a better human — causing his producer, Rita, played by Andie MacDowell, to fall in love with him. 
“Groundhog Day” was directed and cowritten by Harold Ramis, Murray’s fellow Ghostbuster and a partner from their Second City days. The film is lovable and sweet. The film is lovable and sweet. If “Scrooged” seemed to reflect a dour discontent, this one is more optimistic about the human race, and the Murray character is likable by the  
Groundhog Day is a 1993 comedy directed by Harold Ramis, starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell. It was written by Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis and based on a story by Rubin. In the film, Murray plays Phil Connors, an egocentric Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania TV weatherman who, during a hated assignment covering the annual Groundhog Day event (February 2) in Punxsutawney, finds himself repeating  
Groundhog Day is of course an ingenious premise: a jerk is stuck in a time loop forced to relive the same day over and over and over until he becomes a kind, generous man and finally understands love. It's a moral tale that will almost certainly stand the test of time. 
Title Screen : Movie Title/Year and Scene Descriptions: Screenshots: Groundhog Day (1993) In writer Danny Rubin and director Harold Ramis' science fiction/romantic comedy, set in the town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania during the annual Groundhog Day festivities: 
The movie is about a weatherman in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania who finds himself in a time loop after covering Groundhog Day. He begins to re-think his life after hedonism and suicide attempts. The movie was released on February 12, 1993 and got good reviews. It made $70,906,973 at the box office. 
Groundhog Day is routinely heralded as one of the all-time great film comedies, and it is not hard to see why – from script to cast to direction to editing, from inception to execution, this is pretty much a perfect movie. Its basic premise is an intriguing one, although by no means does it automatically guarantee comic gold. 
Today Detective Brett Hopper will be accused of shooting state attorney Alberto Garza. He will offer his rock solid alibi. He will realize he's been framed. And he will run. Then he will wake up and start the day over again. Detective Charlie Crews was framed, convicted and cleared for a crime he  
Happy Death Day cleverly combines horror, humor, and a time loop premise, creating a unique and thrilling counterpart to Groundhog Day. The protagonist's quest to solve her own murder within a repeating day mirrors Phil Connors' journey of self-improvement, balancing suspenseful mystery with comedic elements.

However, “Groundhog Day” popularized the premise in the 1990s, to the point that the film’s title is synonymous with the premise it utilizes. Since “Groundhog Day” gained fame, movies like “ Edge of Tomorrow ,” “ Happy Death Day ” and its sequel and “ Looper ” have all taken their own spins on the concept.. 
Groundhog Day isn't the only movie to feature characters trapped in a time loop. We run down 14 other films that have a similar plot.  “Happy Death Day 2U,” winks at that premise by having  
Only in terms of the stuck-in-time thing. Please don't give away any big plotlines or any spoilers but I love that sort of plot (like with the trickster/angel in s3 I think, if you watch Supernatural) of stuck in time.

Perfect example is movie Groundhog Day, repeating some time segment until you get the things right.  Not a movie, but Russian Doll on Netflix has a similar premise  
This movie is so charming. It starts out with Phil Connor, the Bill Murray character, doing his Bill Murray. Cynicism emanating from every pore. 
The movie, as everyone knows, is about a man who finds himself living the same day over and over and over again. He is the only person in his world who knows this is happening, and after going through periods of dismay and bitterness, revolt and despair, suicidal self-destruction and cynical recklessness, he begins to do something that is alien to his nature. </p>
