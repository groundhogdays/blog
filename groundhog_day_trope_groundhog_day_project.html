        <h2><strong>groundhog day trope groundhog day release info</strong></h2>
        <p>Groundhog Day is a 1993 fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin, and starring Bill Murray.Known for massively popularizing the time loop trope (to the extent that it's referred to on this site as the "Groundhog Day" Loop), cementing its namesake day into the modern lexicon as a stand-in for an unpleasant, repetitive situation, and serving as a  
Though not the earliest example, this trope is named after the 1993 film Groundhog Day, which established the trope in Western popular culture. The Ur-Example of the trope is The Defence of Duffer's Drift from 1904, although in that case the loop traversals are dreams of Lieutenant Backsight Forethought which permit him (and the reader) to  
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
"Groundhog Day" turns 30 years old on February 12. While the classic movie was not the first time-loop story, it was crucial to developing the trope. 
The popularity of Groundhog Day caused the term "groundhog day loop" or "groundhog day trope" to mean a repetitive situation or, specifically in fiction, to stand for the narrative concept that  
The ‘ Happy Death Day ’ films are a fresh new take on the ‘Groundhog Day’ trope. Tree, played by Jessica Rothe , is reliving the day that she was murdered. Quite the opposite of ‘Palm Springs’ take, but Tree must figure out who the killer is and the reason for the murder so she has a chance to break out of the cycle alive. 
I can understand, though, if most people recognize the time loop trope from the 1993 film “Groundhog Day” starring Bill Murray (“Ghostbusters”). Murray’s character, Phil Connors, is a weatherman who goes to Punxsutawney, Pa., to report on Groundhog Day and finds himself repeating the same day over and over. 
Pop Culture Holiday: TV stations typically celebrate the film on February 2nd along with the real Groundhog Day. To keep the reference, some stations will run a marathon of nothing but the movie over and over until the day passes. Retroactive Recognition: The assistant weatherman who's taking Phil's slot for the 10 o'clock show? It's Mozzie  
Popularized by the 1993 film Groundhog Day, the time loop trope has been featured in many pieces of media over the last few decades. In honor of this year’s Groundhog Day, let’s take a look at this popular phenomenon. What is this trope, why does it work so well, and what are some books that feature this trope? 
Groundhog Day is a well-loved 1993 film that massively popularized the time loop trope. With Bill Murray at his deadpan best and a much lauded script, the film is considered a modern classic. 
The musical adaptation of Groundhog Day, which opened at the Old Vic Theatre in London in 2016 and then transferred to Broadway in 2017.With a book written by Danny Rubin (who penned the original film) and songs by Tim Minchin, the musical tells the familiar story of disgruntled weatherman Phil Connors trapped in a "Groundhog Day" Loop where he is forced to relive the titular holiday over and  
Groundhog Day: Like Father Like Son is a direct video game sequel to the original Groundhog Day film.. You play as the charming but arrogant Phil Connors Jr., who grew up alongside his brother Jake and sister Sophie in the shadow of their father - a man who spent a lifetime repeating a single day until he had made it perfect. 
Phil's Driven to Suicide montage, while a brilliant bit of Black Comedy, is also pretty tragic when you think about it. Phil then wakes up to find himself still trapped in the loop. His subdued "Aw, nuts" when he wakes up just drives it home. He  
Phil had to overcome the seven deadly sins in order to escape the time loop.Almost all of the seven deadly sins make an appearance in the movie. Think about it: Sloth: Sitting around in a bathrobe watching game shows till he has them memorized. 
The Swedish title translates as "Monday the entire week". The movie, however, does not specify what day of the week it is supposed to be, and Groundhog Day (February 2) in 1993 was a Tuesday. The German title of the movie is Und täglich grüßt das Murmeltier, which can be translated as "The groundhog greets every day". The title has been  
From the musical: The mayor is doting over Phil the groundhog before the party, with Rita in proximity, and consistently notes that the smiling groundhog has a "tint of sadness" each repeating day. But on the perfect day, Phil the weatherman's final day in the time loop, the "tint of sadness" line is conspicuously absent. 
For a little bit of Black Comedy, the montage of Rita slapping Phil day after day (sort of), even though it leads directly to his Despair Event Horizon. When Rita first reveals she majored in Nineteenth Century French Poetry, Phil can't help guffawing and exclaim, "What a complete waste of time!" 
The trope-naming Bill Murray comedy Groundhog Day is the most commonly known version of this trope, in which Jerkass weatherman Phil Connors (Murray) wakes up every day at 6 A.M. on 2nd February (Groundhog Day) in Punxatawney, PA. 
Instances of the "Groundhog Day" Loop in video games. In 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim, Nenji Ogata is put through this as a form of Virtual-Reality Interrogation, in which he must relive the same afternoon repeatedly until he finds a certain key  
Why It's Important to Contemplate How the Time Loop Works Part One: Recursion vs. Iteration Computer scientists would probably be familiar with recursive vs iterative loops. For those who aren't, here's an analogy; imagine you wish to read a  </p>
