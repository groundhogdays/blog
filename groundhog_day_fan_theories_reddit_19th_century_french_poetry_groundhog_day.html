        <h2><strong>groundhog day fan theories reddit famous groundhog day groundhogs names</strong></h2>
        <p>He knows this apparently, because he's kept track of time by reading one page of a book every day. In the film, though not explicitly mentioned, I believe the timeline is shortened to around 10,000 days. My theory is that each day that Phil has been stuck in this time loop, time continues as normal for everyone else in that world. 
I just rewatched Groundhog Day (1993) with my wife last night. It's my favorite movie, and though I haven't watched it as much as some people , it's easily the movie I've seen the most times. This time through, I caught something real subtle that seems to be an entire hidden plot line in the film: I'm pretty sure Phil grew up in Punxsutawney  
Re-watching Groundhog Day, something jumped out at me: on a number of occasions, Bill Murray's character dies and the movie continues instead of immediately jumping to the next day at 6:00 am. The first time is after Bill Murray drives off the cliff with the groundhog, the camera cuts to Larry and Rita for a few seconds.

i always wondered what made the loop end. and i have a theory. most people think the day just resets on 6:00 am. but it does not. everyday 
This Groundhog Day fan theory about Ned Ryerson being the devil will blow your mind. Share this article 146 shares share tweet text email link Charles Curtis. February 2, 2024 7:15 am ET  
The ever-persistent fan theory of Phil Connors' buying insurance to break his Groundhog Day curse adds a layer of meta-commentary to a movie that already has so much to say. 
Evidence makes for a good theory, this will be judged at the discretion of the mods. Rule 3 - Theories must be about creative works. r/FanTheories is a place for theories based on fictional pieces of media such as, but not limited to, TV shows, movies, and games. Theories pertaining to real life events, such as the moon landing, are not allowed  
I originally posted this a year ago today (): First and foremost: When Phil first encounters Ned he insults him. Immediately after the insult Phil steps into a puddle, and Ned remarks, "Well-ha-ha! 
Groundhog Day is a comedy classic and a fan theory about Bill Murray’s comedy classic has proven to be very popular on Reddit.The movie never explained why Phil Connors was trapped in a time  
My sister and I annually watch this movie on Grounds Hogs day, and we always think that the bartender is in on it. My theory is that Phil is a looper, but I believe that the Bartender is someone who is aware of the loops, and is able to tell every time a loop occurs in which Phil interacts with him, hence the smirk. 
[Groundhog Day] Ned Ryerson is the devil, and imprisons Phil Conners in the time loop when Phil refuses to purchase Ned's insurance. The only way Phil escapes is by finally agreeing to buy it. First and foremost: 
In my theory the first interaction with the alarm clock is just the start of a normal day. Had he not interacted with Ned he never would've experienced that moment with the alarm clock again. So I'm saying on the first day Ned damns Phil to continually start that day over and over, and he takes his first step into his cursed life. 
Groundhog Day never really ends, it’s a parasite that gets passed from person to person. That’s my theory. Let Me explain: There’s a theory on reddit that Phil Connors is in hell/purgatory and that Ned Ryerson is/was the devil (need link). This video covers that idea but doesn’t link the post. I remember reading it years ago here too. 
I originally posted this a year ago today (): First and foremost: When Phil first encounters Ned he insults him. Immediately after the insult Phil steps into a puddle, and Ned remarks, "Well-ha-ha! 
Therefore for Groundhog Day the curse of a single repeating day symbolized the 2,922 days that Bill Clinton would be in control of the most powerful levers of power in the world. This is why the song that plays each morning is “ I got you ” And just like the other media I decoded, the film is an appeal for people to flip to 666. 
Groundhog Day is one of my family's Thanksgiving movies (along with Charlie Brown and The Wiz, for whatever reason), so I was thinking about some of the theories associated with the movie, like how he's been living the same day for thousands of years, or how the bartender is a guardian angel type and is coherent while he's reliving those days. 
The problem with posts like these are that people are no longer posting "fan theories" in the sense the sub was originally meant; everyone is now deconstructing things and just analyzing them through real world lens, not creating theories that work with the logic of whatever universe we're discussing. But whatever. 
Basically, the assumption is that Ned has run through 500 times already when Phil starts his Groundhog Day, and Phil's day constantly overwrites Ned's 501st day. This would explain why Ned's actions are slightly different on the days that Phil acts wildly differently. 
It may seem obvious that's what he has wanted since day 1, of course he wants out. Of course he doesn't want to keep reliving the same day. But that's just it, Phil was depressed, he didn't want to live at all. </p>
