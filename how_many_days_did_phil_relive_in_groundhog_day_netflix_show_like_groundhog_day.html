        <p>Groundhog Day follows Bill Murray’s character, Phil Connors, a TV weatherman who becomes mysteriously trapped in a time loop during a reporting trip to Punxataney, PA, for the town’s annual  
Ever since the movie "Groundhog Day" was released in 1993, fans have wondered how long Bill Murray's character was forced to relive February 2nd. 
Phil relives the same day approximately 12,400 times in Groundhog Day, equating to almost 34 years. Groundhog Day director Harold Ramis initially believed Phil was trapped for 10 years, but later went back on his stance. 
How many times did Bill Murray relive Groundhog Day? How long was Murray’s character in the time loop and how many Groundhog Days did he relive?  director Harold Ramis said Phil relived the  
According to WhatCulture.com — which meticulously took into account the 38 days actually shown during Groundhog Day; the 414 days that were mentioned; the 11,931 days Phil spent learning things like ice sculpting, French poetry, and playing the piano; and the days he spent performing good deeds — Harold's second estimate was much closer. 
Phil experiences a mind-boggling amount of repeated days over the course of the film, and someone has actually taken the time to work out how long he was stuck living the same day over and over. The truth is even crazier than you might think – not to mention utterly terrifying. Bill Murray starred in Groundhog Day in 1993Columbia Pictures 
The most false, when it comes to Groundhog Day, is the widely-reported notion that an early version of Rubin's script had Phil explicitly saying to Rita that he had been "waiting for you every day  
How long was Phil Connors stuck in Groundhog Day? Bill Murray's character relives the same day more than 12,000 times. Yahoo UK Staff. Fri, February 2, 2024 at 9:12 AM UTC. 2 min read. 
Widely considered to be one of the best comedy movies of all time, "Groundhog Day's" story of weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) struggling to break free from living the same 24-hour period  
How long was Murray’s character in the time loop and how many Groundhog Days did he relive? This might be one of the greatest mysteries of cinema that has never truly been revealed. However, in a commentary special feature of the movie, director Harold Ramis said Phil relived the day for 10,000 years, before later saying it was probably about  
Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years. Deezen noted that the second draft of the screenplay called for Phil to be cursed to live the time loop for 10,000 years. In the DVD commentary, Ramis estimated a real-time duration of 10 years. 
Bill Murray's role as Phil Connors in 1993's Groundhog Day is one for the ages, especially considering he hated his experience behind-the-scenes just as much as his character did onscreen! 
TIL the number of days Phil (Bill Murray's character) repeated Groundhog Day in the movie was 38, but in actual time it was calculated to be 8 years, 8 months and 16 days. hollywoodreporter.com Open 
Believe it or not, the actual number of times Murray’s Phil Connors relives the same day might actually surprise a fair amount of people. As it stands, according to calculations by one intrepid  
Earlier this year on the traditional Pennsylvania holiday of Groundhog Day (February 2), Sky aired the film 13 times in a row for 24 hours. More about Groundhog Day Pennsylvania Bill Murray 
In honor of Groundhog Day last week — when Punxsutawney Phil predicted an early spring (so we got that going for us [and, yes, I am mixing my Bill Murray movie references]) — Gallagher pinpointed the exact number of Groundhog Days Murray's Phil Connors endures in “Groundhog Day:” 12,403 days. 
So just how much of those 10,000 years did Phil spend trapped in a loop? According to WhatCulture, Phil only spent 33 years and 350 days repeating the same day over and over again, or 12,395 times to be exact. P.S. In case you were wondering, Punxsutawney Phil did not see his shadow earlier today, and so we get an early spring! 
I've several times wondered for how long was Phil Connors stuck in that loop. There are the on-screen shown days which I estimate around 40. But then, Phil learns lot of stuff about the people of the town, he learns French poetry, piano, ice sculpting, etc. But there are also the spoken-about days. 
In case you didn't know, February 2nd is Groundhog Day. And to celebrate the momentous American holiday that inspired the bloody brilliant Bill Murray film of the same name, as well as the movie  
How long did Phil relive Groundhog Day? That’s because Bill’s character, Phil, evidently spent a whopping 12,395 days trapped in Punxsutawney on Groundhog Day. This translates to 33 years and 350 days by the way. </p>
