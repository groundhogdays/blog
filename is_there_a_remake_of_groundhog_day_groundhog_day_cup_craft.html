Though fans will likely never get to see a Groundhog Day 2, there have been off-shoots of the film that exist in other media.Groundhog Day: Like Father Like Son is a virtual reality video game  
Hollywood, CA - Sony Entertainment has announced that it will soon release a sequel to the 1993 hit Groundhog Day that is exactly the same as the last one.

Fans of the 1993 classic film Groundhog Day have also wanted to see sarcastic weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) and company raise their heads in a sequel to hit film. However, nearly 30 years after its release, it seems that a follow-up film is

For now, there is no indication that the series is actually getting made beyond Toblowsky's word. Until an official announcement is made, fans will have to make do with the original Groundhog Day  
Called Groundhog Day: Like Father Like Son , the video game will be a sequel to the 1993 comedy and will be available exclusively on PlayStation VR. Groundhog Day is a comedy starring Bill Murray as Phil Conners, a weatherman who has to travel to the small town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania in order to cover a bizarre public event known as  
Sony has announced that the sequel to 1993 movie Groundhog Day—in which a TV weatherman relives the same day over  but I imagine there will be plenty of motion control-based shenanigans in

Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly.
