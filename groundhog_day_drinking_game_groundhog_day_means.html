You’re gonna need to catch up by drinking the prescribed amount of Straub Groundhog Brew every time you see the following cliches: DRINK FOR 5 SECONDS any time some dork mentions the movie Groundhog Day or tosses out some tired-ass Bill Murray reference.

Groundhog Day doesn’t have to be just another winter day—it’s such a fun excuse to get crafty and play a few games! With these 23+ ideas, you’ll have plenty of ways to keep the kids engaged and smiling, whether you’re at home or in the classroom.

It’s full of minor discomforts: Phil (Bill Murray) is away from home at a cheesy B&amp;B, the weather is brutal, his job is banal, and his coworkers are annoying.

Naturally, drinking must accompany an occasion of this caliber. But since we will be piss drunk and hungover from the Super Bowl at 6 in the morning, we will drink to the movie Groundhog’s Day.
