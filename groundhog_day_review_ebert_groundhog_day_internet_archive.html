Every year on Feb. 2 he is dispatched to Punxsutawney, Pa., to cover the festivities of Groundhog Day, on which Punxsutawney Phil, the groundhog, is awakened from his slumbers and studied to discover if he will see his shadow. If he does, we will have another six weeks of winter. 
Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert review the 1993 film "Groundhog Day" starring Bill Murray and directed by Harold Ramis. Both critics gave the movie two thumbs up. 
One of my favorite things that Ebert does as a reviewer is: he goes back and reviews films years after their release. He re-assesses them, and re-assesses his own original review. Really interesting.

Murray’s Groundhog Day character is not too far removed from Martin’s in PT&amp;A.  This article also links to Ebert's contemporaneous review of The Life Aquatic  
The movie, as everyone knows, is about a man who finds himself living the same day over and over and over again. He is the only person in his world who knows this is happening, and after going through periods of dismay and bitterness, revolt and despair, suicidal self-destruction and cynical recklessness, he begins to do something that is alien to his nature. 
Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert review the 1993 film "Groundhog Day" starring Bill Murray and directed by Harold Ramis. Both critics gave the movie two thumbs up. 
When Roger Ebert inducted “Groundhog Day” into his Great Movies series in 2005, he admitted that he underrated the film in his original review. “I enjoyed it so easily that I was seduced into cheerful moderation,” Ebert wrote. “But there are a few films, and this is one of them, that burrow into our memories and become reference points. 
On February 12, 1993, Bill Murray lived the same day over and over and over again in theaters nationwide. And Groundhog Day, directed by Harold Ramis, wound up as a commercial success and an
