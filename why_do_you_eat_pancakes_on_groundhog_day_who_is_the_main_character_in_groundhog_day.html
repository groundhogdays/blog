        <p>The origins of Groundhog Day and its food traditions. Groundhog Day is a popular tradition in North America that falls on February 2nd. The origins of this event can be traced back to the ancient pagan festival of Imbolc, which marked the halfway point between the winter solstice and the spring equinox. 
In a North American tradition that dates back to early Pennsylvania German settlers, February 2 is also known as "Groundhog Day." Legend has it that if a groundhog emerges from its hole on February 2 and sees its shadow, there will be 6 more weeks of winter weather! While the candles may have gone out long ago, "pancake" day lives on. 
Eating pancakes on February 2 also has its origins in pagan festivals. In those days, Candlemas referred to the fertility of the earth. Farmers used to bake crêpes with surplus flour from the  
A primarily religious festival. Candlemas, celebrated on February 2, takes its name from the Latin word "candelaria", meaning "festival of candles".This celebration has its roots in several ancient traditions. 
If you don’t want the wheat to rot, eat pancakes at Candlemas. Pancakes were prepared using surplus flour from the previous year. To ensure a good harvest and prosperity in the coming year, some people flipped the pancake while holding a gold coin in the other hand. With the same aim, others placed the first pancake on top of the wardrobe. 
Today, Feb. 2 is Groundhog Day or Candlemas Day if you are European. In the U.S., we celebrate this Pennsylvania Dutch tradition which was made famous in the popular Bill Murray movie "Groundhog  
It turns out there is a reason why these holidays fall on the same day.

So, if you’re an American Francophile, take your pick. 
Forget Shrove Tuesday, France’s version of Pancake Day is La Fête de la Chandeleur (or simply ‘La Chandeleur’), held every year on February 2nd. Naturally, crêpes are the star of the show, but the French pancakes aren’t just for eating. There’s also a host of bizarre traditions and superstitions surrounding the sweet treats. 
Groundhog Day is one of the most superstitious holidays in the United States, though rest assured, Americans aren’t the only ones subject to mythical beliefs. Similarly, the French also celebrate a superstitious holiday on February 2nd, though it has little to do with marmots predicting the weather—and in classic French form, a lot more to  
In north America on 2 February, the point of mid-winter, they celebrate Groundhog Day. If you’ve ever seen the film you’ll know it’s the date on which a groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil emerges from his cosy hidey-hole to predict the weather. According to legend, there’s only ever been one Phil – since 1886. 
Why do you eat pancakes on Groundhog Day? Groundhog Day is a popular holiday in the United States and Canadamarked by a special type of event: The Groundhog Day celebration. During this celebration, a groundhog is held up to a crowd, and if it sees its shadow, it means there will be six more weeks of cold weather. 
Turn the hob off, if it is safe to do so, put a lid on the pan if you can and if the fire is getting out of control, get out of the house and call 999. British Pancake Day traditions. The pancake race 
What is Groundhog Day and why do we celebrate it? Groundhog Day is an annual holiday celebrated on February 2 in the United States and Canada. It originates from the Pennsylvania Dutch superstition that if a groundhog (or marmot, or woodchuck) emerges from its burrow on this day and sees its shadow, it will retreat to its den and winter will  
The holiday has roots in pagan and Catholic beliefs. Today you’ll find La Chandeleur is associated with eating crêpes, gathering with friends and family, and practicing rituals to bring good luck to the coming year. It also has a connection with Groundhog Day in the US, since this day is said to predict the weather for the rest of winter.

La Chandeleur might just be the most superstitious day of the year in France. Pancake day has a lot to do with superstition in France, still nowadays. It might be the remains of the pagan origins of this celebration. There are still many sayings or traditions around February 2nd: À la Chandeleur, l’hiver se passe ou prend vigueur 
Since we’ve used one for years, I have learned that they do work best with a boxed pancake mix, not a homemade recipe that is usually to thick and starts to puff up pretty quickly. Now, back to groundhog day John formed and flipped six different pancakes to make the groundhog face!!! 
What do you do on shrove Tuesday? Well, on Shrove Tuesday (Also known as Pancake Day), I normally eat pancakes. 
Groundhog Day Pancakes. Groundhog day is just around the corner when Punxsutawney Phil will pop up his head and tell us if we should stick with our boots and sweaters or pull out the flip flops. (Well, luckily I’ve already got the flip flops out, but most people in the country aren’t so lucky.) 
Americans often spend February 2 huddled in the cold waiting for a groundhog to emerge from the earth, but the French have a much more fun way to spend the day. </p>
