The director Harold Ramis didn't intend for his movie Groundhog Day to be heralded by religious thinkers as an example of how to live life, but that's exactly what happened after it was released  
The Movie: Groundhog Day. Groundhog Day, the 1993 movie with Bill Murray, has become an icon in popular culture. In the Movie, Bill Murray plays Phil Connors, an obnoxious, self-centered news weatherman. 
Groundhog Day originated from an ancient European tradition called Candlemas Day, where clergy would bless candles and distribute them to ward off the darkness of winter. The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. 
An unusual, yet beloved holiday February 2nd is Groundhog Day, the day when a groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil predicts whether or not we will have six more weeks of winter. If he sees his shadow, more cold is on the way; if not, warmer weather is coming. While this holiday may seem like a silly tradition, it has a surprisingly deep history. Ancient Traditions 
The Metaphysics of Groundhog Day Lawrence Crocker says it’s about time, and personal identity, and free will. The 1993 movie Groundhog Day was, of course, made as an exploration of the metaphysics of time. The basic idea is that for on-location TV weatherman Phil Connors, the same Groundhog Day, February 2, in Punxsutawney keeps repeating. 
Watched Palm Springs last night and really enjoyed it, the fact that both protagonists remember the loop day adds to the intimacy and journey (IIRC only bill Murray’s character has memory in Groundhog Day?). An enjoyable 90 minutes.

Harold Ramis’ 1993 movie “Groundhog Day” is so entertaining, you’ll want to see it again, and again, and again. Explore meanings and central themes in the movie. 
Groundhog Day shows us that if we lived long enough, all of us would eventually choose to live more morally. In Groundhog Day, we learn that there's no point worrying about the past or future. We should worry most about the present and how we treat other people in the moment. 
Imagine you’re stuck in a time loop where the same day repeats itself over and over like in “Groundhog Day”. It’s a nice normal sunny day. Imagine it runs for  
TIL learned that the "Groundhog Day" loop could have lasted upwards to 10,000 years and as little as 10 years according to the Writer and Director Harold Ramis en.wikipedia.org Open Share 
A pop-up jar groundhog is a playful decoration that will brighten any shelf. It’s a cute way to keep the Groundhog Day excitement going all season. Place a brown pom-pom groundhog on a stick, put it in a jar, and decorate with other Groundhog Day motifs. When kids push the stick, the groundhog “pops up.”

Groundhog Day. Movie: Directed by Harold Ramis, Screenplay by Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis. Inciting Event: After covering Groundhog Day and being stuck in Punxsutawney, Phil wakes again at 6AM to his clock radio playing “I’ve Got You Babe,” the same song (a recurring motif of the film) as the previous day . He realizes it is not a radio  
The Groundhog Day inspirations are obvious in this movie, but it feels fresh with how the time loop mechanic is used as a source of dark humor, cathartic change, and character development. Both Samberg and Milioti bring tons of fun and chemistry to their roles, making Palm Springs one of the most enjoyable in the genre. </p>
