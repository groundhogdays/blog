How accurate are Phil's "predictions"? In 2015, he forecast six more weeks of winter (he saw his shadow), but it wasn't meant to be. 
No Shadow; Guested on the Oprah Winfrey TV Show and made new fans. 1994: Ô∏è More winter: Saw Shadow 7:28 AM. 1993: Ô∏è More winter: Saw Shadow. ‚ÄúGroundhog Day‚Äù The movie with Bill Murray was released in time for PHIL‚ÄôS Predition. 1992: Ô∏è More winter: Saw Shadow. 1991: Ô∏è More winter: Saw Shadow. 1990: üåº Early spring: No Shadow
