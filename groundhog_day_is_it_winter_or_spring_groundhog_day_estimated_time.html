        <p>Of course, this prediction only refers to winter weather — and not the actual season — as the Spring Equinox consistently falls within the same two-day span each year. Annually, Groundhog Day  
What is Groundhog Day? People flock to Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, on Feb. 2 every year to be a part of the celebrations revolving around Punxsutawney Phil's winter forecast. 
Here's what to know about Groundhog Day. Weigh in on spring:Will Buckeye Chuck see his shadow?  Feb. 2 marks the midpoint between the winter solstice in December and the spring equinox in March  
"Today the Germans say the groundhog comes out of his winter quarters," read the diary entry, "and if he sees his shadow he returns in and remains there 40 days." 
Groundhog Day is a tradition that has taken place annually in the town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania since Feb. 2, 1987. A groundhog, also known as a woodchuck, is brought out at sunrise to make a prediction on how the remaining winter will play out. 
Groundhog Day has a rich history based on a deeper meaning; it speaks to the triumph of spring over winter—and birth over death. Again, note the appearance of light over dark with the appearance of candles and dawn—and, of course, the spiritual light of a holier presence. 
It derives from the Pennsylvania Dutch superstition that if a groundhog emerges from its burrow on this day and sees its shadow, it will retreat to its den and winter will go on for six more weeks; if it does not see its shadow, spring will arrive early. In 2024, an early spring was predicted.

See how the groundhog became a symbol for predicting seasonal changes in America, rooted in German folklore with a badger — which in turn lead to Groundhog Day. 
Of course, even the organizers of the annual Groundhog Day event in western Pennsylvania acknowledge that turning to a large rodent for weather forecasting is mostly a way to break up winter monotony. 
A great memorable quote from the Groundhog Day movie on Quotes.net - Man in Hallway: Think it'll be an early spring? Phil: Winter, slumbering in the open air, wears on its smiling face a dream of spring. Ciao. Man in Hallway: Ciao. 
Groundhog Day is a beloved tradition for many as they wait to see how long winter will last. As the legend goes, if Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow, he predicts six more weeks of winter. If he doesn't, it's a forecast of an early spring. 
Here's what the weather forecast shows for Punxsutawney Phil's prediction for Groundhog Day on Sunday  are expected to invade much of the U.S. for the rest of winter and early spring this year

Groundhog handler AJ Derume holds Punxsutawney Phil, who saw his shadow, predicting late spring during the 136th annual Groundhog Day festivities on Feb. 2, 2022, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania.
