        <p>Groundhog Day at the Old Vic review: I could watch Tim Minchin and Danny Rubin’s show again and again  And of course, it’s fitting that Broadway actor Andy Karl is back in the role of Phil  
If this production doesn’t end up with a long run in the West End (and it should), it would make a great alternative to the Old Vic’s annual Groundhog Day-like repeat of A Christmas Carol. Groundhog Day The Musical can be seen at The Old Vic in London until 19 August 2023. Paul was given a complimentary review ticket. 
If any show was tailor-made for repeat viewings, it’s Groundhog Day.It’s not just the inspired time-loop premise of Danny Rubin’s tale – first seen in his 1993 existential romcom movie, then in this stage musical adaptation with Tim Minchin for the Old Vic in 2016 – but the extraordinary intricacy of both writing and staging, which mean that each encounter with it reveals new wonders. 
Review of Tim Minchins Groundhog Day musical at The Old Vic, London starring Andy Karl and Tanisha Spring. After 7 years, Tim Minchins musical returns to London in a show that feels refreshingly familiar. 
There’s more than a whiff of familiarity down at London’s Waterloo at the moment; Olivier award-winning Groundhog Day is back at the Old Vic and so is Andy Karl, playing the sneering  
Groundhog Day, appropriately, is back where it started. The hit film about a TV weatherman’s endlessly reiterated day in small-town USA moved to the Old Vic stage in 2016; but then its progress became bumpy, despite the awards showered on it and its lead, Andy Karl, on both sides of the Atlantic. Karl was injured during a Broadway preview and the show's US tour didn't happen.

Groundhog Day Musical, Old Vic Theatre 2016 review: ★★★★★ Back off Broadway, we might just have the best new musical since Hamilton – right here in London. A new day has dawned for hit 1993 film Groundhog Day. It brings a songbook bursting with instant classics and even a touch of tap dancing. 
The ensemble sing big joyful anthems to spring and hope and groundhogs; all the innocent human smalltownery which Phil is punished by the wise gods of myth for despising. Not many shows involve both a giant groundhog playing the drums and tearful resolution to live better. Minchin magic. Groundhog Day runs at the Old Vic Theatre to 19 August.

Their new musical Groundhog Day is a cast-iron triumph, both joyful and profound, incredibly funny and seriously moving. Danny Rubin’s book follows the lineaments of his 1993 film (directed by Harold Ramis and starring Bill Murray ) but the production intelligently reimagines and remixes the ingredients for the stage. 
Reviews are coming in for the Olivier Award-winning musical Groundhog Day at The Old Vic theatre in London.. With music and lyrics by Tim Minchin (Matilda The Musical), and direction by Matthew Warchus, Groundhog Day has a book by Danny Ruben, who co-wrote the screenplay of the original movie, which starred Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell. 
A review of Groundhog Day, the musical version by Tim Minchin and Danny Rubin on at the Old Vic until August 2023. Better than the original! 
It is Groundhog Day for Groundhog Day. Tim Minchin’s musical adaptation of the much-loved 1993 movie first appeared at the Old Vic in 2016, but its subsequent Broadway run was cut short and an

Groundhog Day review “Brutally brilliant” Reviews Jun 9, 2023 by Sam Marlowe Old Vic, London. Tanisha Spring and Andy Karl in Groundhog Day at the Old Vic, London. Photo: Manuel Harlan. 
On paper, the happy new musical “Groundhog Day,” which opened on Tuesday night at the Old Vic Theater here, seemed like one of those shows that elicit instant groans of “been there, done  
Groundhog Day comes to rest on a note of affirmation all too rarely expressed these days in the world at large: "I'm here and I'm fine," reports Phil, who has come to realise in the tradition of many an emotive musical that a new day can also be the cue for, yes, a new life. Groundhog Day at the Old Vic until 17 September </p>
