Supernatural season 3 episode "Mystery Spot" is a perfect parody of Groundhog Day, especially with its use of Asia's "Heat Of The Moment." Supernatural arrived in 2005 and follows the Winchester brothers Dean (Jensen Ackles) and Sam (Jared Padalecki). They hunt evil creatures and other supernatural foes, with the first season focusing on their  
Mystery Spot is the 11th episode of Season 3. It premiered on February 14th, 2008. Sam and Dean investigate the disappearance of a man who went missing at a tourist location. While searching the site, Dean is shot and killed by the owner. Sam is devastated but stunned when he wakes up the next morning to find Dean alive and well. As the day unfolds, Sam realizes he is re-living the previous

Dean: Like Groundhog Day. Groundhog Day was a 1993 movie starring Bill Murray, where his character relives the same day over and over. Other references to Groundhog Day include Sam waking to the same song every morning, though in Groundhog Day the song is "I Got You Babe" by Sonny and Cher.

Season three's "Mystery Spot" gave fans a tasty slice of Groundhog Day fun, as seen through the eyes of Sam Winchester. He awoke each morning to the sound of this classic tune, as he relived the  
Like "Groundhog Day". SAM Yes, exactly. Like "Groundhog Day". DEAN, nodding Uh-huh. SAM So you don't believe me. DEAN (laughs) It's just a little crazy, I mean even for us crazy, you know, like, uh— SAM Dingo ate my baby crazy? DEAN How'd you know I was going to say that? SAM Because you said it before, Dean, that's my whole point. DORIS 
I really can't say "just one" song that reminds me of Supernatural. There are plenty. Carry on my wayward son - Kansas Heat of the moment - Asia All out of love (dean singing was amazing) - Air Supply Can't fight this feeling - REO Speedwagon Simple Man - Lynyrd Skynyrd Mr. Fantasy - Traffic 
Mystery Spot: Directed by Kim Manners. With Jared Padalecki, Jensen Ackles, Jim Beaver, Richard Speight Jr.. Sam relives the same day over and over, continually having to deal with Dean's death. 
What was the name of the song after Dean dies for real on Wednesday and Sam is in his car? 
heat of the moment (supernatural). it’s less about liking the songs and more about liking the situation. what other time loop songs are there? edit: dream loops also work! edit 2: so do things like mmm watcha say and the song from inception, but i’m more so looking for the other stuff 
Really interesting take on the Groundhog Day principle, which ties in well with the Supernatural story as you see a change in Sam as he becomes more ruthless, determined and detached from others in trying to change Dean's fate. 
In the episode 3.11 Mystery Spot Sam relives a Groundhog Day-like universe in which Dean dies every day under strange and inevitable circumstances. The color filter that usually darkens the picture and makes every Supernatural episode a bit grainier and bleak looking isn't used for most of the episode, but it comes back just when Zachariah  
I think I've loved every Groundhog Day premise movie/tv show I've ever seen: the original movie, The X-Files episode "Monday", Happy Death Day, and Happy Death Day 2U. This was a worthy addition to the genre. I remember this episode being funnier on first watch than I found it this time.

Supernatural is a show that can be, well, ridiculous every now and then. Sometimes, it's great. Sometimes, it's laughable. Sometimes, it's best to just mute the sound and stare at the actors  </p>
