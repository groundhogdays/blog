Mel died just before Groundhog Day, leaving his community in central New Jersey "at a tough time of year, when most of his fellow groundhogs are hibernating." In a Facebook post, the wranglers

Groundhog Day in Quebec took a grim turn when the province’s beloved furry oracle, Fred la Marmotte, was found dead hours before he was expected to make his  
Its Groundhog Day was “magical,” said Korman, who started hosting Groundhog Day Eve parties with 20 friends packed into his small apartment.  But more focus on Milltown’s dead groundhog

The original Wiarton Willie lived to the advanced age of 22, and was found dead only two days before Groundhog Day in 1999.
