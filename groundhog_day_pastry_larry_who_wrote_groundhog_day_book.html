A narcissistic TV weatherman, along with his attractive-but-distant producer, and his mawkish cameraman, is sent to report on Groundhog Day in the small town of Punxsutawney, where he finds himself repeating the same day over and over. 
There's something familiar about Larry the camera guy in Groundhog Day — y'know, beside the fact that you see him do and say the same things on repeat. 
Phil: When Chekhov saw the long winter, he saw a winter bleak and dark and bereft of hope.Yet we know that winter is just another step in the cycle of life. But standing here among the people of Punxsutawney and basking in the warmth of their hearths and hearts, I couldn't imagine a better fate than a long and lustrous winter.

At first, Harold Ramis’ GROUNDHOG DAY seems like a typical Bill Murray comedy with the iconic leading man standing one step away from the rest of humanity, always quick with an ironic insult. But the film cleverly turns Murray’s sarcastic outsider persona against him and the film evolves into a sweet fable about humanity. 
LARRY: Would you be at all interested in seeing the inside of the [weather] van? Nancy declines (goodness—why on earth would she pass up such an amazing opportunity!) and Larry alter runs onstage at the Groundhog Day party to be auctioned off as a bachelor. All he gets is a twenty five-cent bid from an old woman. Poor Larry. Womp womp. 
Larry, Phil Connors, Groundhog Day When Chekhov saw the long winter, he saw a winter bleak and dark and bereft of hope. Yet we know that winter is just another step in the cycle of life. 
Groundhog Day: Directed by Harold Ramis. With Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliott, Stephen Tobolowsky. A narcissistic, self-centered weatherman finds himself in a time loop on Groundhog Day. </p>
