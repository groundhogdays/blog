The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder.

The History of Groundhog Day The Christian religious holiday of Candlemas Day has become most commonly associated with the current celebration, but it’s roots are older than that.

But, history shows a shadow sighting and six more weeks of winter is the more likely outcome.  Here's when Groundhog Day began: The first mention of Groundhog Day came in 1886 in Punxsutawney. 
Stephen Tobolowsky, who played Ned Ryserson, in the movie Groundhog Day, attended the 2010 Groundhog Day Celebration in Punxsutawney. Danny Rubin, writer of the screenplay Groundhog Day, attended Groundhog Day 2013. This was the first time he attend Groundhog Day since before the movie was released.
