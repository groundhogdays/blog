        <h2><strong>groundhog day holiday meaning groundhog day is it good</strong></h2>
        <p>The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
Groundhog Day, in the United States and Canada, day (February 2) on which the emergence of the groundhog from its burrow is said to foretell the weather for the following six weeks. In the United States the most popular event occurs in Pennsylvania and centers on a groundhog designated Punxsutawney Phil. 
Groundhog Day, celebrated every year on February 2, is an unusual holiday that stretches back hundreds of years back to European traditions and even ancient times. How is Groundhog Day Celebrated? Groundhog Day is famously connected to weather prediction, with the most prominent tradition involving a groundhog predicting the conclusion of  
The holiday stems from a centuries-old Pagan and Christian tradition, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. It is also known as St. Brigid’s Day.  While the Groundhog Day tradition as we  
See how the groundhog became a symbol for predicting seasonal changes in America, rooted in German folklore with a badger — which in turn lead to Groundhog Day. 
The History of Groundhog Day. The Christian religious holiday of Candlemas Day has become most commonly associated with the current celebration, but it’s roots are older than that. The celebration started in Christianity as the day, (February 2nd), when Christians would take their candles to the church to have them blessed. 
The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The annual ritual has roots in pre-Christian traditions and was brought to the U.S. by  
Most of us know the tradition: on February 2, our old friend the groundhog will emerge from hibernation, come out of his den, and predict whether winter will deliver more cold weather this year. If the groundhog sees his shadow, the story goes, cold weather will persist another few weeks. If not, warm weather is around the corner. If you like the folklore of holidays, you may be interested to  
In 1993, the film Groundhog Day starring Bill Murray popularised the use of the term ‘groundhog day’ to mean something that is endlessly repeated.It also popularised the event itself: after the film came out, the crowd at Gobbler’s Knob grew from around 2,000 annual attendees to a staggering 40,000, which is nearly 8 times the population of Punxsutawney. 
An unusual, yet beloved holiday February 2nd is Groundhog Day, the day when a groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil predicts whether or not we will have six more weeks of winter. If he sees his shadow, more cold is on the way; if not, warmer weather is coming. While this holiday may seem like a silly tradition, it has a surprisingly deep history. Ancient Traditions 
The groundhog is known as Punxsutawney Phil, because the town where the Groundhog Day tradition originated is called Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. A big celebration is still held in the town to this  
If it’s cloudy and he doesn’t see his shadow, it’s said to mean an early spring.  Groundhog Day is an astronomy holiday, whose roots are embedded in Earth’s yearly orbit around the sun. 
Groundhog Day is a holiday celebrated in the United States and Canada on February 2, each year. In weather lore, if a groundhog emerges from its burrow on this day and fails to see its shadow because the weather is cloudy, winter will soon end. 
Groundhog Day is a quirky tradition celebrated every February 2nd. Ever wondered why we rely on a groundhog to predict the weather? Groundhog Day has deep roots in folklore and history, blending ancient customs with modern fun. This day revolves around a groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil, who emerges from his burrow to forecast the coming of  
European Origins. The origins of Groundhog Day date back to medieval Europe. The day of 2 February corresponds with Candlemas, a Christian festival (see Religious Festivals) during which candles are lit, hence the celebration’s name. 
In the American tradition of Groundhog Day, the nation’s groundhog prognosticators take a stance on the season ahead. If the groundhog sees his shadow, he predicts six more weeks of winter. 
Groundhog Day is perhaps one of the Pennsylvania Dutch community's most well-known cultural inventions – although the Amish themselves do not celebrate it, since it is not a religious holiday  
Our modern Groundhog Day tradition mixes elements of both, but it is in essence rooted in the weather: if it’s a sunny day, the groundhog sees its shadow, meaning a longer winter. If it’s overcast, get ready for spring. Famously, Punxsutawney Phil is only accurate ~40% of the time, meaning that Groundhog Day isn’t really about reliable  
Where does the phrase ‘Groundhog Day’ come from?
