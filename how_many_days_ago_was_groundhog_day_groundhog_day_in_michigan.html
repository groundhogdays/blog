Of course, this prediction only refers to winter weather — and not the actual season — as the Spring Equinox consistently falls within the same two-day span each year. Annually, Groundhog Day

In honor of Groundhog Day last week — when Punxsutawney Phil predicted an early spring (so we got that going for us [and, yes, I am mixing my Bill Murray movie references]) — Gallagher pinpointed the exact number of Groundhog Days Murray's Phil Connors endures in “Groundhog Day:” 12,403 days.
