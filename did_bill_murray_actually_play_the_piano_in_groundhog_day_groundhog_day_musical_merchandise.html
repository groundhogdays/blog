        <p>Did Bill Murray Actually Play The Piano In Groundhog Day? Even though Billy Murray wasn’t even able to play much piano by Paganini on Christmas Day when the day came, he did learn some to play. While some of Bill’s miming may seem questionable, one can safely assume that it was all Bill in the wider shots. 
Bill Murray does not play the piano regularly. However, he did learn to play just enough to appear passable in his “Groundhog Day” piano scene. Close-ups in the scene were performed by a double but Murray did play at least perform some of the music in the scene. 
Bill Murray – Groundhog Day . Despite using a double for the close-ups, Bill Murray learned just enough piano to play some of Rachmaninov’s ‘Rhapsody on a Theme by Paganini’. Some of the miming looks a tad questionable, but in the wider shots, it was apparently all Bill. 
Somehow, these weighty topics get weaved through many hilarious moments, thanks largely to the efforts of star Bill Murray. For Murray, Groundhog Day proved his acting skills could take on broader  
2.According to the website Wolf Gnards, Bill Murray spends 8 years, 8 months and 16 days trapped in Groundhog Day. Woodstock Square Park, which was Gobbler’s Knob in the film.Photo: activerain Another website, claims he was trapped 12,403 days, just under 34 years, in order to account for becoming a master piano player, ice sculptor, etc. 
In the film, the only way Phil could get out of the time loop was if he learned to live the day perfectly. Along the way he learned to play the piano, caught a falling child after he fell out of a  
Bill Murray — Groundhog Day Columbia Pictures Bill Murray can't read music but learned piano by ear to play some of Rachmaninov’s "Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini", in the scene with his piano  
A bit of a cheat since director Harold Ramis used a double for the close-ups, but Bill Murray did learn enough piano to actually play in Groundhog Day. Learning was part of the script as his character relives the same day over and over. 
Did Bill Murray learn piano for Groundhog Day? Bill Murray’s character, Phil Connors, took piano lessons at the home in the film. The house was built in 1893 but has been updated generously over the years. It still has the entryway, porch and living room that fans of “Groundhog Day” will recognize. What Mozart song was in Groundhog Day? 
Bill Murray doesn’t play the piano on a regular basis. He did, however, learn to play just enough to make himself passable in his piano scene from “Groundhog Day.” A double performed close-ups of the scene, but Murray did at least perform some of the scene’s music. What instrument does Bill Murray use? Bill Murray is unable to read music.

Phil, fascinated by the classical piano song after having heard it on the radio, decided to learn to play piano. So he found a teacher and in order to get a  
"According to the website Wolf Gnards, Bill Murray spends 8 years, 8 months and 16 days trapped in Groundhog Day. The website Obsessed With Film claims he was trapped 12,403 days, just under 34 years, in order to account for becoming a master piano player, ice sculptor, etc." 
TIL the number of days Phil (Bill Murray's character) repeated Groundhog Day in the movie was 38, but in actual time it was calculated to be 8 years, 8 months and 16 days. 
The premise of Groundhog Day (the movie) is brilliantly simple. Bill Murray plays weatherman Phil Connors, a sarcastic, egotistical narcissist who gets stuck in a time loop and is forced to relive  
Bill Murray's role as Phil Connors in 1993's Groundhog Day is one for the ages, especially considering he hated his experience behind-the-scenes just as much as his character did onscreen! Despite  
“I would say it was the catalyst that put Punxsutawney Phil from having 5,000 people come for Groundhog Day to having 35,000 people come for Groundhog Day. That was the impact that the movie had.“ “Bill Murray was a lot of fun. He was very cordial to everybody in Punxsutawney and he was signing autographs — a very nice man.

This is Phil's piano solo from the end of the film "Groundhog Day". He can be seen playing this at the town party. I have another version here on youtube.  
In Groundhog Day, Bill Murray's character, Phil Connors, becomes trapped in a time loop, but the film never explicitly specifies just how many times Phil relives the same day over and over. Directed by Harold Ramis and co-written by Danny Rubin, Groundhog Day follows a cynical weatherman (Murray) who finds himself stuck in Punxsutawney  </p>
