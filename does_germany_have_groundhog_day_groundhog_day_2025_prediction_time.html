        <p>It was 1961 before the groundhog was dubbed “Punxsutawney Phil” and the tradition began to attract a wider audience of about 2,000 people. But the biggest change came following the 1993 Groundhog Day movie starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell (German title: Und täglich grüßt das Murmeltier). The crowds soon swelled to 10,000. 
The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
This, of course, is the legendary Groundhog Day, a uniquely North American tradition steeped in folklore and fun. But did you know its roots lie not in snowy fields, but in the sun-drenched meadows of Germany? That’s right, Groundhog Day, with its quirky charm and weather predictions, bears the distinct paw prints of German immigrants. 
(Apparently Groundhog tastes like a cross between pork and chicken. YIKES!) The Groundhog feast eventually faded away (thankfully) but the visit to Gobbler’s Knob continued, and became more ritualistic. Since the release of the film Groundhog Day, the crowd in Punxsutawney has grown from 2000 to over 10,000 visitors. 
February 2 is Groundhog Day in the U.S. and Canada, though probably everybody in the world knows about this weather-predicting custom since the movie Groundhog Day (Und täglich grüßt das Murmeltier) with Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell came out in 1993. But I would bet few know of the German origins of this weather lore day. What is Groundhog Day? Every year on February 2 in the

Germany – Badger Day: In Germany, instead of relying on groundhogs, they turn to badgers for their weather predictions. On February 2nd, Germans observe “Dachstag” or Badger Day. According to folklore, if a badger emerges from its burrow and sees its shadow, it will be frightened and retreat back into hibernation for another six weeks of  
The American tradition of Groundhog Day has its roots in the German religious holiday Mariä Lichtmess, also known as Candlemas. Beginning in the 1840s, German immigrants to Pennsylvania had observed the tradition of a hedgehog predicting the end of winter. They adapted the groundhog as replacement meteorologist since there were no hedgehogs in  
Groundhog day originally came from an old tradition called Candlemas Day that started in the United States in 1887 in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania.  However, originally in Germany, they used the  
In other words, the Groundhog Day tradition may have begun as a bit of folk humor. Famous prognosticators and predictions. Towns throughout North America are known to have winter-predicting groundhogs. The most famous is Punxsutawney Phil of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania (immortalized in the movie Groundhog Day). 
The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records.

This was a  
Groundhog Day, in the United States and Canada, day (February 2) on which the emergence of the groundhog from its burrow is said to foretell the weather for the following six weeks. In the United States the most popular event occurs in Pennsylvania and centers on a groundhog designated Punxsutawney Phil. 
Originally, Groundhog Day was a Celtic festival marking the year’s first cross-quarter day, or a midpoint between seasons. Read more about the ancient Celtic calendar here. Celebrated at the beginning of February, the day was called Imbolc —a term from Old Irish that is most often translated as “in the belly”—a reference to the soon  
The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The annual ritual has roots in pre-Christian traditions and was brought to the U.S. by  
Groundhog Day is always on Feb. 2. Essentially, a groundhog is made a weather forecaster. If it gets up in the morning and sees its shadow, there will be six more weeks of winter. If no shadow is  
And what does February 2nd have to do with it? But Groundhog Day actually has deep roots in a much older Christian tradition. Furthermore, the day that we celebrate Groundhog's Day has some real meteorological significance, designating the halfway point between two important markers in the changing of the seasons (via EarthSky.) 
As the groundhog was all the rage at the time, Groundhog Day took off, celebrated for the first time on February 2, 1887. The popularity of the groundhog is described below: “In the 1880s  groundhog was the cuisine of choice at the Punxsutawney Elks Lodge. 
At first glance, Groundhog Day may not seem to have emerged from strict scientific principles or a rational Enlightenment worldview, but it’s not as bananas as you might think. As a child, I liked Groundhog Day just like anyone else does, which was: it was fun but I didn’t really get it. </p>
