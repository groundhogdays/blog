        <p>These days celebrate events considered joyous to Korea. In the beginning, Independence Declaration Day (March 1) was first stipulated in 1946. [9] After the establishment of the Government of the Republic of Korea in 1948, four major National Celebration Days (Independence Declaration Day, Constitution Day, Liberation Day, National Foundation Day) were provided by "The Law Concerning the  
The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
Historically, this is probably the most important day for Koreans. This is the day when the peninsula was finally free from the occupation of Japan as World War 2 ended and Japan surrendered. It’s basically the independence day for Korea and recognizes all the sacrifice and struggle for years under the Japanese occupation. 
In the movie “Groundhog Day,” Bill Murray is fated to repeat one day of his life over and over – and such a description is quite apt for relations between Korea and Japan. North Korea’s histrionics yet again dominated media headlines and managed to overshadow the inauguration of Park Geun-hye in February 2013, even while [] 
She spearheaded the passage of the ``Korean War Veterans Recognition Act, U.S. Public Law 111-41," which was signed by President Obama on July 27, 2009, 56 years to the day after the Korean War  
Groundhog Day is a widely celebrated tradition in North America, particularly in the United States and Canada. Every year on February 2nd, people eagerly await the emergence of a groundhog from its burrow to predict the arrival of spring. However, this unique holiday is not limited to just these two countries. 
This day once substituted Seollal (Lunar New Year) and was a three-day holiday, but now it is just one day off. In South Korea, although families do not gather as they do for the Lunar New Year, it is common to eat tteokguk (rice cake soup) at home, and some families also celebrate New Year’s Day on January 1st of the Gregorian calendar. 
Chuseok (Korean Thanksgiving Day) Chuseok falls on the 15th day of August according to the lunar calendar and is also known as Gabae, Gawee, Hangawi or Jungchujeol. Families practice an ancestral memorial ceremony called Charye by filling a table with food such as newly harvested rice and Songpyeon (a traditional rice cake which is made with

Date: The 1st day of the 1st Lunar Month – January 29 (in 2025) After New Year’s Day, the most important holiday in Korea is Seollal, also known as Lunar New Year.

Groundhog Day is a popular tradition that takes place in North America, particularly in the United States and Canada. Every year, Groundhog Day is on February 2. Groundhog Day came from the Pennsylvania Dutch. The colonists believed that if a groundhog came out of its burrow and saw its shadow due to clear weather, it would retreat back into  
Groundhog Day Gróundhog Dày in the U.S., February 2. According to old stories, if it is sunny on this day, there will be six more weeks of winter. 성촉절(聖燭節) ((한 해의 가장 추운 달이 끝나고 봄이 시작됨을 알리는 날. 2월 2일)) 
Where does the phrase ‘Groundhog Day’ come from? 
Groundhog Day is celebrated in Canada and the United States every year on 2 February. Legend has it that watching a groundhog emerge from its burrow can determine the weather forecast for the coming weeks. 
Today all across the US and Canada, many communities celebrate their own version of Groundhog Day. In Canada alone, there are a half dozen places with a Groundhog Day tradition. In French Canada the day is called Jour de la marmotte. “Fred la marmotte of Val-d’Espoir” has been the winter forecaster for the province of Quebec since 2009. 
Following the popularity of the 1993 Bill Murray movie "Groundhog Day," the event increased in popularity. Thousands of people have turned out for recent events. So, who is Punxsutawney Phil? 
Ultimately, A Day is a Groundhog Day premise with Hitchcockian twists, and a delectable dollop of the bittersweet that audiences have come to expect from such South Korean stunners as The Handmaiden, Mother, and I Saw The Devil. Even when you get a happy ending in this oeuvre, it’s one edged with brilliant pain. 
midget38 - I'm thinking it's time to rent Groundhog Day again as Feb. 2nd is rolling around again. Glad you enjoyed the hub, and thanks so much for sharing! Michelle Liew from Singapore on January 19, 2013: I loved the facts and the dirt pie recipe! Groundhog Day starring Bill Murray was a great, funny film. </p>
