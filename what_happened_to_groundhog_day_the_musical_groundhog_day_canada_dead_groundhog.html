        <h2><strong>what happened to groundhog day the musical groundhog day news live</strong></h2>
        <p>The musical is based on the 1993 film Groundhog Day. [3] The film itself starred Bill Murray as Phil Connors and Andie MacDowell as Rita Hanson and was produced on a budget of $14.6 million, earning over $70 million in domestic box office receipts. [4] 
He played Phil in the original London production, for which he won the Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Musical, reprising his role in the Broadway production where he was Tony Nominated for Best Actor in a Musical, and he played Phil again in London for Groundhog Day’s record-breaking return season at the Old Vic in 2023. 
What happened to the national tour of Groundhog Day the Musical? After a successful Broadway run, Groundhog Day was slated to begin an 18-month national tour in 2018. So what happened? According to Playbill, the tour was unceremoniously canceled in January 2018. Composer and lyricist Tim Minchin weighed in, saying “Sadly (despicably) there  
What better day than Groundhog Day to plan a production of well, Groundhog Day? Music Theatre International has released the West End and Broadway title, adapted from the 1993 film, for  
Broadway Musical ‘Groundhog Day’ to Close in September  the 1993 movie on which the show is based — “Groundhog Day” earned critical raves at London’s  Milk Scene Really Happened  
The Groundhog Day musical will soon be free of its time loop.. The stage adaptation of the beloved 1993 movie will close on Broadway, with its final performance set for Sept. 17 at the August  
Groundhog Day has a book by the movie’s original co-screenwriter Danny Rubin, and music and lyrics by Olivier Award winner Tim Minchin (Matilda the Musical). MTI’s President and CEO Drew Cohen said in a statement:“Groundhog Day is one of my favorite films and the musical is a fantastic re-imagining of the source material. 
Well this is fitting: “Groundhog Day” is back. Again. The story of a jaded weatherman fated to live the same day over and over began as a beloved movie, then became an award-winning stage musical. 
Synopsis. A beloved comedy classic is brought to the stage in Groundhog Day.Phil Connors, a sarcastic and self-centered TV weatherman from Pittsburgh, dreads his trip to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, every year, where he is forced to report on the annual Groundhog Day festivities. 
Weatherman Phil Connors is furious at having to travel to Punxsutawney, Philadelphia, to report on the doings of groundhog Phil, whose behaviour on February 2 predicts the weather to come. “There’s nothing more depressing than small town USA/And smaller doesn’t come smaller/Than Punxsutawney on Groundhog Day,” he sings, scornfully.

groundhog day is a musical about so many things okay it's not just about phil being implied bisexual, it's about absurdism, it's about nihilism, it's about existentialism, it's about giving up on hope in the most positive way possible, it's about facing the inevitability of death, it's about accepting the horrible things in life it's about loving the people around you not for your own self  
#duet with @Ian Nieboer listen I have room in my heart for more than one groundhog-based musical Mad thanks to Oliver for bringing this obsession into my life this month, and to everyone for bringing their creativity to it! #punxsutawneyphil #Duet #broadway #musicaltheatre #groundhogmusical 
groundhog day is a musical about so many things okay it's not just about phil being implied bisexual, it's about absurdism, it's about nihilism, it's about existentialism, it's about giving up on hope in the most positive way possible, it's about facing the inevitability of death, it's about accepting the horrible things in life it's about loving the people around you not for your own self  
TikTok content creators are fixating on a Groundhog Day musical — not to be confused with the actual 2016 Groundhog Day musical. The songs are written from Phil and his wife Phyllis’ perspective. 
What Song Is Playing Every Morning When Phil Connors Bill Murray Wakes Up At The Bed And Breakfast In Punxsutawney? Music is a crucial part of the fun in “Groundhog Day” (1993), which sees a bed and breakfast in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania being rented out to the cast of the film’s fictional character, Phil Connors (played by Bill Murray). 
Critically acclaimed on both the West End and Broadway, Groundhog Day revels in one man's journey of self-discovery, day after day. Inspired by the hilarious film starring Bill Murray, Groundhog Day features a book by original co-screenwriter Danny Rubin, and music and lyrics by Tony Award nominee Tim Minchin (Matilda the Musical). 
Opening Night of Groundhog Day: The Musical was a highly anticipated event for me. I am a huge Tim Minchin fan and was excited to see how his satirical comedic wit and mind-blowing musical ability would transform the popular 1990s movie through the addition of his music and lyrics. 
Of course, a real Groundhog Day musical does exist, with music and lyrics by Tim Minchin and a book by Danny Rubin. The musical made its world premiere at The Old Vic in London in summer 2016 and  
As he navigates the repetitive day with humor and wit, Phil discovers that true change comes from within. Featuring catchy songs by Tim Minchin, the composer of MATILDA The Musical, sharp comedy, and a poignant message about redemption and love, this musical is a delightful celebration of second chances and self-discovery. </p>
