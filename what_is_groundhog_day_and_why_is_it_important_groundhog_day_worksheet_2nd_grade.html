        <h2><strong>what is groundhog day and why is it important groundhog day number of days</strong></h2>
        <p>The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder.

A drink called ‘groundhog punch’ was also served. This was formalised with the formation of the official Punxsutawney Groundhog Club in 1899 which, along with hosting Groundhog Day itself, continued the hunt and feast.

An unusual, yet beloved holiday February 2nd is Groundhog Day, the day when a groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil predicts whether or not we will have six more weeks of winter. If he sees his shadow, more cold is on the way; if not, warmer weather is coming. While this holiday may seem like a silly tradition, it has a surprisingly deep history. Ancient Traditions 
"Groundhog Day is a film that resonates with audiences on a deep level. It‘s a story about the power of self-reflection, personal growth, and the importance of living each day to the fullest." – Roger Ebert, film critic.

A Groundhog is a small, furry animal that looks like a mixture of a squirrel and a badger. According to the tradition, each year one of the furry creatures can predict when spring will arrive. 
And what does February 2nd have to do with it? But Groundhog Day actually has deep roots in a much older Christian tradition. Furthermore, the day that we celebrate Groundhog's Day has some real meteorological significance, designating the halfway point between two important markers in the changing of the seasons (via EarthSky.) 
The movie features a reporter who is covering the famous Groundhog Day ceremony in Punxsutawney, but because he never changes his ways, the same day keeps repeating over and over again. No matter how you celebrate the day, there is no denying Groundhog Day is a classic American tradition. 
Groundhog day is a movie directed by Harold Ramis (who died today) and stars Bill Murray (Reddit Royalty) and also has Stephen Tobolowsky in it who recently did a AMA. It is said to be "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".
