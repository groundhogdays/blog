Of course, this prediction only refers to winter weather — and not the actual season — as the Spring Equinox consistently falls within the same two-day span each year. Annually, Groundhog Day

We also see temperatures of less than 10° about 30.7% of the time and temperatures above 40° about 31.4% of the time. Groundhog Day in 2024 was somewhat mild with a high of 46° and a low of 37°.
