        <h2><strong>where did the saying groundhog day come from groundhog day watch australia</strong></h2>
        <p>The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
In 1993, the film Groundhog Day starring Bill Murray popularised the use of the term ‘groundhog day’ to mean something that is endlessly repeated.It also popularised the event itself: after the film came out, the crowd at Gobbler’s Knob grew from around 2,000 annual attendees to a staggering 40,000, which is nearly 8 times the population of Punxsutawney. 
Where does the phrase ‘Groundhog Day’ come from? 
See how the groundhog became a symbol for predicting seasonal changes in America, rooted in German folklore with a badger — which in turn lead to Groundhog Day. 
Every year on February 2, crowds gather at Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to watch a groundhog emerge for the day—just like in the classic Bill Murray film Groundhog Day. You  
"Groundhog Day is a reminder that even in the midst of the coldest, bleakest times, we can find joy and laughter in the simple things. It‘s a celebration of the resilience of the human spirit." – Dr. Lisa Thompson, psychologist. In many ways, the themes of the "Groundhog Day" movie mirror the enduring appeal of the tradition itself. 
According to an old British saying, “If Candlemas Day be (sir) bright and clear, there’ll be two winters in the year.” So, where did the groundhog come from? We can thank 19th-century German immigrants and a creative editor at the Punxsutawney Spirit newspaper for this twist. 
MACON, Ga. — Groundhog Day has been an annual tradition since the very first celebration was held on Feb. 2nd, 1877 in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. If the groundhog sees its shadow, there is six  
The original Groundhog Day, however, is a North American folklore festival celebrated every year on 2 February. According to American folklore, if the groundhog emerges from its hibernation burrow in early February on a sunny day, it will see its own shadow and then re-hibernate for a few more weeks indicating a longer winter than usual. 
“Last Tuesday, the 2nd, was Candlemas day, the day on which, according to the Germans, the Groundhog peeps out of his winter quarters and if he sees his shadow he pops back for another six weeks  
Starring Bill Murray as Phil Connors, a cynical weatherman who finds himself reliving the same day over and over again, Groundhog Day mixes humor with philosophical themes. Alongside Murray, the film stars Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliott. Groundhog Day received critical acclaim upon release and has since become a cultural touchstone. 
Its premise is simple — Murray plays a weatherman, named Phil Connors, that becomes trapped in a time loop on Groundhog Day. Part of what makes this movie so great is the script and all of these famous Groundhog Day quotes.

Phil: Rita, I’m reliving the same day over and over. Groundhog Day. Today. Rita: Okay. I’m waiting for the punch line. Phil: No. Really. This is the third time. It’s like yesterday never happened! Rita: I am racking my brain, but I can’t even begin to imagine why you’d make up something like this. Phil: I’m not making it up. I am  
Groundhog day originally came from an old tradition called Candlemas Day that started in the United States in 1887 in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. 
You say Groundhog Day, I say Grundsaudaag: how German and Swiss settlers in Pennsylvania created a new language – and a much-loved American holiday. 
While May 1 became May Day, and November 1 became All Saints’ Day, the February 1 holiday was pushed to the following day – and would eventually become Groundhog Day. 
Groundhog Day Bill Murray does warmth in his most consistently effective post-Stripes comedy, a romantic fantasy about a wacky weatherman forced to relive one strange day over and over again, until he gets it right. 
February can be a tough month. The days are still short, the magic of the holidays has ebbed, and spring break feels miles away. If you’re in need of a fun lesson plan to shake things up, look no further than Groundhog Day! With Gale In Context: Elementary, the lesson plan is easy to pull </p>
