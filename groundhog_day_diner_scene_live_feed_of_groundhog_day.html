Funny and profound, Groundhog Day holds up on repeat viewing, allowing you to catch the jokes and sight gags you might have missed the first time. In honor of another Groundhog Day, I put together a list of the film’s 50 funniest moments, including an amusing bit that’s in one of the deleted scenes that didn’t make the final movie. 
Trapped in his existential time loop, Bill Murray’s Phil Connors keeps living the same day over and over and learning the wrong lessons (until he learns the right ones), but at least while he’s stuck in Punxsutawney, he gets to enjoy a virtually unlimited number of diner breakfasts. 
A look at 17 stories surrounding the film 'Groundhog Day' in January 2023.  In one of Groundhog Day’s many memorable scenes, Phil sits in a diner shoveling assorted pastries and sugary treats

2.According to the website Wolf Gnards, Bill Murray spends 8 years, 8 months and 16 days trapped in Groundhog Day. Woodstock Square Park, which was Gobbler’s Knob in the film.Photo: activerain Another website, claims he was trapped 12,403 days, just under 34 years, in order to account for becoming a master piano player, ice sculptor, etc. 
Based on this scene, how many times has Bill Murray been through this day? 
Ever since the making of Groundhog Day in 1992, each year Woodstock residents still get together to celebrate Groundhog Day. Woodstock has its own Groundhog Day festival, complete with a dinner dance, free showings of the movie, and a walking tour of some of the sites where the movie was filmed. THE TIP TOP CAFE 
Other activities include a Groundhog Day Story Time, a Welcoming of the Groundhog ceremony, trivia nights, movie screenings, Breakfast with Willie’s Woodland Friends, a walking tour of filming sites, and a Groundhog Day Dinner Dance at the Woodstock Moose (where the bachelor auction and dance scenes were filmed).

The film locations for Groundhog Day are supposedly in Pennsylvania, but most of the film was shot in Illinois.. There’s a brief moment of scene setting in Pittsburgh, with an aerial shot of the city wedged between the the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers, as cynical TV weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) and his crew head off to ‘Punxsutawney, Pa’ to cover the annual Groundhog Day  
The Brief. Woodstock, Illinois, became the filming location for "Groundhog Day" (1993), and the town now celebrates the movie with an annual festival that attracts visitors from around the world. 
From the Recipe Creator: Many split pea soups use ham and bacon for good, smoky flavor. Taking it one amazing step farther-add crabmeat. Freeze this one without toppings (freeze the cooked bacon separately), then reheat soup in a saucepan. 
In the movie Groundhog Day, Bill Murray's character experiences a time loop where he is forced to relive the same day repeatedly. This phenomenon causes him to undergo personal growth and self-reflection as he tries to break free from the cycle by changing his actions and attitudes towards others.
