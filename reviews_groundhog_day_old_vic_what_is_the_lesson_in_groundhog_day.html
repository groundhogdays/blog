        <p>Groundhog Day at the Old Vic review: I could watch Tim Minchin and Danny Rubin’s show again and again  And of course, it’s fitting that Broadway actor Andy Karl is back in the role of Phil  
If this production doesn’t end up with a long run in the West End (and it should), it would make a great alternative to the Old Vic’s annual Groundhog Day-like repeat of A Christmas Carol. Groundhog Day The Musical can be seen at The Old Vic in London until 19 August 2023. Paul was given a complimentary review ticket. 
There’s more than a whiff of familiarity down at London’s Waterloo at the moment; Olivier award-winning Groundhog Day is back at the Old Vic and so is Andy Karl, playing the sneering  
If any show was tailor-made for repeat viewings, it’s Groundhog Day.It’s not just the inspired time-loop premise of Danny Rubin’s tale – first seen in his 1993 existential romcom movie, then in this stage musical adaptation with Tim Minchin for the Old Vic in 2016 – but the extraordinary intricacy of both writing and staging, which mean that each encounter with it reveals new wonders. 
Review of Tim Minchins Groundhog Day musical at The Old Vic, London starring Andy Karl and Tanisha Spring. After 7 years, Tim Minchins musical returns to London in a show that feels refreshingly familiar.

Groundhog Day, appropriately, is back where it started. The hit film about a TV weatherman’s endlessly reiterated day in small-town USA moved to the Old Vic stage in 2016; but then its progress became bumpy, despite the awards showered on it and its lead, Andy Karl, on both sides of the Atlantic. Karl was injured during a Broadway preview and the show's US tour didn't happen. 
Turned into a much loved film of the same name in 1993, it features Hollywood star Bill Murray as the story’s lead Phil Connors – a self assured weather man forced to relive Groundhog Day on repeat. The much loved film also enjoying life as a musical, making its debut at the Old Vic in 2016 before making its return 7 years later.

Groundhog Day Musical, Old Vic Theatre 2016 review: ★★★★★ Back off Broadway, we might just have the best new musical since Hamilton – right here in London. A new day has dawned for hit 1993 film Groundhog Day. It brings a songbook bursting with instant classics and even a touch of tap dancing.

Review. Groundhog Day. 5 out of 5 stars.  It feels like a snowy American echo of another Old Vic hit, ‘A Christmas Carol’ – and one that also deserves to run, and run, and run. 
Their new musical Groundhog Day is a cast-iron triumph, both joyful and profound, incredibly funny and seriously moving. Danny Rubin’s book follows the lineaments of his 1993 film (directed by Harold Ramis and starring Bill Murray ) but the production intelligently reimagines and remixes the ingredients for the stage. 
Reviews are coming in for the Olivier Award-winning musical Groundhog Day at The Old Vic theatre in London.. With music and lyrics by Tim Minchin (Matilda The Musical), and direction by Matthew Warchus, Groundhog Day has a book by Danny Ruben, who co-wrote the screenplay of the original movie, which starred Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell.
