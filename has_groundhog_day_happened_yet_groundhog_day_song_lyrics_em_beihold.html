        <p>When is Groundhog Day 2025? Groundhog Day will take place Sunday, Feb. 2, 2025. Thousands will show up in person, with the grounds to Gobblers Knob opening at 4 a.m., and millions will tune in to see if Punxsutawney Phil will see his shadow. More: Where to watch Bill Murray's 1993 classic movie 'Groundhog Day' for Groundhog Day. What is  
In 1886, Groundhog Day was acknowledged for the first time in Punxsutawney by a local newspaper, Weathers Wags, according to the club. In 1887, the first official pilgrimage to see Phil on Gobbler  
The Groundhog Day celebration at Gobbler's Knob started in 1887. Aside from a 10-year gap, records for each prognostication have been meticulously kept. Over the years, Phil has predicted six more  
Of course, this prediction only refers to winter weather — and not the actual season — as the Spring Equinox consistently falls within the same two-day span each year. Annually, Groundhog Day  
The first official Groundhog Day took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The event took up permanent residence at Gobbler’s Knob the following year. 
Groundhog Day and Candlemas Lore. If Candlemas [February 2] be mild and gay, Go saddle your horses and buy them hay; But if Candlemas be stormy and black, It carries the winter away on its back. Just half your wood and half your hay, Should be remaining on Candlemas Day. On Candlemas Day, The good goose begins to lay. 
Groundhog Day, Feb. 2, is coming up, and soon Punxsutawney Phil will tell us what to expect from the weeks to come. The holiday dates back hundreds of years, and has grown to be a widely  
Groundhog Club handler A.J. Dereume holds Punxsutawney Phil, the weather prognosticating groundhog, as vice president Dan McGinley reads the scroll during the 138th celebration of Groundhog Day on Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pa., Friday, Feb. 2, 2024. 
Many people gearing up for Groundhog Day, when eyes are on Punxsutawney Phil to learn if six more weeks of winter or an early spring is on the horizon. While Groundhog Day is Feb. 2, celebrations  
Here's what to know about Groundhog Day 2025. When is Groundhog Day 2025? Groundhog Day is Sunday, Feb. 2. Though not a federal holiday, Americans tune in annually Feb. 2 to see if the famed  
Whether or not the groundhog sees his shadow has no actual bearing on how much longer winter weather lasts, but it's a fun tradition. It has yet to be proven whether Bill Murray actually spent Groundhog Day 1993 in a several-years-long time loop. However, it also has yet to be technically disproven. 
This quirky tradition, known as Groundhog Day, has captured the hearts and imaginations of generations. But where did this unusual custom come from, and why has it endured for so long? In this article, we‘ll delve into the rich history of Groundhog Day, exploring its ancient roots, early celebrations, and modern-day significance. 
Every day he lives out Groundhog Day and when he goes unconscious one way or another he time travels back to the same starting point of that same Groundhog Day. Everyone still has free will, but free will means freedom to choose and react how you see fit, it's not a video game random number generator grasping at arbitrary values to keep things  
Groundhog Day has a clever premise, yet it’s surprisingly flat. As directed by Harold Ramis, the routines don’t stagger and build — they’re more like a series of isolated, catch-as-catch  
We’re very lucky we never had to endure a Groundhog Day sequel. There was a video game sequel "Groundhog Day: Like Father Like Son": You’re stuck in a time loop as Phil Connors, Jr., back in Punxsutawney for Groundhog Day in this virtual reality game set in the world of the iconic hit movie. 
Ramis once said Phil was trapped in Groundhog Day for 10 years, even though the original plan was to have him trapped for 10,000 years. According to the website Wolf Gnards, which ran the numbers, Phil was actually trapped for eight years, eight months and 16 days. 
I’ve said for years that they should announce Groundhog Day 2, have Bill Murray do a big press tour about the challenges of filming a sequel so far removed, etc., and then just re-release Groundhog Day in theaters. 
The movie was written by Danny Rubin with work also done by the film's director, Harold Ramis. In the original spec, we just have a guy who keeps waking up on February 2nd, without and introduction until the first time it happened. Ramis thought showing the day Phil realizes he's stuck in a day would really make the movie more relatable for us. 
As they walk off to the inn, the next shot opens closely upon the alarm clock as it changes to 6:00, but the shot fades to black and the sound fades or credit music swells to obscure any reprisal Sonny and Cher may or may not have had. I would have placed Groundhog Day in my top ten films of all time if it had ended this way. 
Best Groundhog Day Quotes. "Phil: Do you ever have déjà vu, Mrs. Lancaster? Mrs. Lancaster: I don't think so, but I could check with the kitchen." - Phil Connors </p>
