        <p>I know I'm years late on this (ironically for Groundhog Day), but just was re-watching.. Yes, the line was cheesy and blatantly silly - but, I think the bartender *is* in on it and is much more important to the story than just a guy pouring drinks. 
He never gives himself up to Phil. By the end of the movie, Phil knows about almost everyone in town but there's no evidence he got to know the bartender. 2. The movie is directed as such as they show the bartender in single shots almost if not every time Phil speaks to him. 
Throughout the film, Phil seems to be the only person in Groundhog Day who knows what he is going to. However, there is a bartender who repeatedly observes Phil, often with a smile. He does this especially when Phil is trying to win over Rita. Was it possible he was suppose to symbplize an angel of sorts? Sent down to make sure Phil would change. 
On February 2, while reporting on the annual Groundhog Festival in the quaint Pennsylvanian town of Punxsutawney, Phil becomes trapped in a time warp where he lives the same day over and over again. 
The bartender, playing the role of the Magical Negro, was the person who caused the infinite time loop— judging by the Knowing Glance towards the camera when Phil finally picks Rita's favorite drink and does her favorite toast. I like the alternative idea that the bartender is also reliving Groundhog Day like Phil, but he just doesn't realize it. 
No matter what Bill Murray's Phil Connors does in Groundhog Day, it's Larry the cameraman who holds the power to make or break him.  The bartender rolls his eyes. We know, however, that the  
When is Groundhog Day 2025? Groundhog Day will take place Sunday, Feb. 2, 2025. Thousands will show up in person, with the grounds to Gobblers Knob opening at 4 a.m., and millions will tune in to see if Punxsutawney Phil will see his shadow.

PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa. -- Here's a look at Groundhog Day, an American tradition that is meant to predict when spring will arrive. Facts. The groundhog emerges from its burrow on February 2. If the  
The Groundhog Day celebration at Gobbler's Knob started in 1887. Aside from a 10-year gap, records for each prognostication have been meticulously kept. 
Here’s what you probably know about Groundhog Day. It’s a seminal early nineties comedy. It stars Bill Murray as grouchy Pittsburgh weatherman Phil Connors, reluctantly sent to cover a yearly groundhog tradition in the small town of Punxsutawney, where he finds himself doomed to repeat the same day over and over (and over) again. 
Here you'll read (for the first time ever, no doubt), about the annual ritual of harassing an unsuspecting groundhog and pretending to know if the animal has found its shadow and wasn't just frantically searching for an escape route or a sign from groundhog Jesus that everything will be Okay. 
Phil is stuck in his loop, and finally released from it, by the bartender. As to why he does it, I don't know. Maybe he's a trickster, a Puka like Harvey perhaps. The bartender silently watches Phil. The first night there, Phil is a jerk. He is rude to the bartender. Watch the bartenders eyes, his reaction. 
The Groundhog Day tradition as we know it dates to 1887. According to the club, Punxsutawney Phil is also known as the: Seer of Seers; Prognosticator of Prognosticators; 
Ned Ryerson never knew Phil Connors, but because he was able to repeat the day over and over, he eventually learned enough about him to piece together a history. Remember, Phil Connors does the same thing later in the movie. So, Groundhog Day is a curse passed from person to person, presumably to change the course of their lives for the better. </p>
