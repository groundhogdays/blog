In 1993, the film Groundhog Day starring Bill Murray popularised the use of the term ‘groundhog day’ to mean something that is endlessly repeated.It also popularised the event itself: after the film came out, the crowd at Gobbler’s Knob grew from around 2,000 annual attendees to a staggering 40,000, which is nearly 8 times the population of Punxsutawney. 
An unusual, yet beloved holiday February 2nd is Groundhog Day, the day when a groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil predicts whether or not we will have six more weeks of winter. If he sees his shadow, more cold is on the way; if not, warmer weather is coming. While this holiday may seem like a silly tradition, it has a surprisingly deep history. Ancient Traditions 
What is Groundhog Day, anyway? Every year on February 2, crowds gather at Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to watch a groundhog emerge for the day—just like in the classic Bill  
America has been looking to Punxsutawney Phil for over 130 years to indicate whether or not we'll have a short or long winter. But Groundhog Day goes back way further than that. Here's the complete history of the holiday, as well as when it is and how Punxsutawney Phil came to be. 
If the day is sunny and the groundhog sees its own shadow, there will be six more weeks of cold weather, according to legend – but if it's a cloudy day, and there is no shadow, spring has arrived. 
On average though, only 42% of Groundhog Days on record have recorded precipitation and only 38% have seen snowfall.

Groundhog metabolism responds to the surface temperatures from deep within their hibernation den, and if the temperature warms up enough, they will be forced out of hibernation and into the world in search of food. This commonly happens while there is still snow on the ground, and explains why groundhog day is celebrated in early February. 
Perhaps the most famous portrayal of Groundhog Day in popular culture is the 1993 film "Groundhog Day," starring Bill Murray. The film is a comedic exploration of the concept of time loops, with the protagonist reliving the same day repeatedly.
