        <h2><strong>groundhog day run lola run youtube groundhog day trailer</strong></h2>
        <p>Run Lola Run (German: Lola rennt, lit. ' Lola Runs ') is a 1998 German experimental thriller film written and directed by Tom Tykwer.The story follows a woman named Lola (Franka Potente) who needs to obtain 100,000 Deutsche Mark in twenty minutes to save the life of her boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu). 
Lola Runs. And runs again. And again. Happy Groundhog Day! Even though I’ve only seen this movie one other time, it’s one of my favorites. There’s plenty to love about Lola. The premise is simple: Lola has twenty minutes to raise the money to save her boyfriend Manni’s life. 
At an unbelievably brisk 80 minutes, the brilliance of Run Lola Run is in its deceptive simplicity. Ember-haired Lola (Franka Potente) receives a call from her boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu  
Run Lola Run. Dir. Tom Tykwer. 1998. Run Lola Run is one of my all-time favorite films though I resisted seeing it at first. Something I’d read clued me in to the fact that it would be one of those stories that has repeating elements (a la Groundhog Day) of which I’m not particularly a fan. However, my husband was teaching at a debate camp  
With its constant repetition and variation of key events, Run Lola Run has a lot in common with time loop movies. There are some absolute classics in this genre, from Groundhog Day to more recent efforts like Palm Springs and Happy Death Day, but despite the none-more-generic title, Edge of Tomorrow remains an underseen gem. 
Lola’s very high concept is fairly easy to grasp. Like Groundhog Day or Sliding Doors or last month’s Twice Upon a Yesterday, it is an exploration of alternative realities, though unlike those films it has almost no philosophical interest in the questions raised by such an exploration. Lola (Franka Potente) gets a phone call from her  
I loved Run Lola Run. So unique and interesting, like many foreign films. It also reminded me of a mashup of Groundhog Day and Sliding Doors. In both Groundhog Day &amp; RLR, the protagonist seems to be aware of their current situation and understands how to potentially fix it. 
But there is little of the romantic-comedy irony of Groundhog Day's repetitions or Sliding Doors' mirrored stories in the crisis that turns into three dramas for Lola. Nor is there an unwavering commitment to the existential crime-plot take on fate and chance that runs from Kubrick's The Killing (1956) to Tarantino. 
Run Lola Run (1998)  The first time I saw "Groundhog Day" I was reminded of a short film called "1201 pm" that I'd seen late one night when I was a teenager. It  
Run Lola Run and Groundhog Day In groups of up to 4, compare and contrast the two films. Answer the following questions with examples from each film. 
Run Lola Run: Directed by Tom Tykwer. With Franka Potente, Moritz Bleibtreu, Herbert Knaup, Nina Petri. After a botched money delivery, Lola has 20 minutes to come up with 100,000 Deutschmarks. 
George Fenton’s Rota-inspired score for Groundhog Day is fine, even during the early ’90s smooth jazz bits, as is the constant cue of Sonny and Cher, but it’s nothing compared to Run Lola  
As Lola interacts with random people on the street, we see rapid-fire images of their futures, diverting wildly from what is amounts to a tiny difference in how Lola interacts with them. Usually in fiction it’s only the protagonists who matter this way. Because there is no true narrative, it differs wildly from time loop movies like Groundhog  
How similar is it to Groundhog Day? Lola (Franka Potente) has to score 100,000 Deutsche Mark in twenty minutes or her boyfriend will die.What follows is a frantic, frenetic flick from Tom Tykwer

Run Lola Run utilizes a time loop structure where the protagonist navigates varying outcomes of repeated events, mirroring Groundhog Day 's exploration of cause and effect within a single day. The urgency and innovative storytelling ensure that each repetition brings new insights and excitement, maintaining engagement in a manner similar to the  
The Groundhog Run 2025 is on Sunday February 2, 2025. It includes the following events: 5K, 10K, 5K &amp; 10K Tunnel-To-Tunnel, Kids Run, 5K Virtual, 10K Virtual, and 5K &amp; 10K Tunnel-To-Tunnel Virtual. 
When "Run Lola Run" seemingly "ended," I thought to myself: Wow! "Lola's" running time was quicker than Lola's. By the time it actually ended, I was exhausted and felt like I had run a marathon. The three different versions of Lola's day are a good example of the butterfly effect in motion: one little change can cause many bigger ones. 
Run Lola Run is the kind of energetic, thrill-seeking movie that you don't expect from a German filmmaker. Like a sexy version of Sliding Doors, or perhaps a Groundhog Day for the next century, it works both on a technical level and as sheer entertainment. Reviewed on: 19 Jan 2001 
"Run Lola Run" is one of the most fun, involving, stylish movies I've seen in a long time. The suspense is high from the get-go, with Lola's boyfriend Manni phoning her to say that if he doesn't get 100,000 deutsche marks within 20 minutes, a gangster will kill him. </p>
