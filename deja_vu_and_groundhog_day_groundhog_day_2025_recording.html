But Groundhog Day has earned another meaning in the past three decades. In the 1993 movie “Groundhog Day” starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell, Bill Murray’s character, Phil, enters a time loop and relives February 2 over and over.

Alongside Murray, the film stars Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliott. Groundhog Day received critical acclaim upon release and has since become a cultural touchstone.
