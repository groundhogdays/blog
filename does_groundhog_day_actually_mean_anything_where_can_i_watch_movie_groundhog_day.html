        <h2><strong>does groundhog day actually mean anything groundhog day rachmaninoff</strong></h2>
        <p>The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
Groundhog Day isn't scientific (in fact, Punxsutawney Phil's weather predictions are wrong most of the time). If we're being honest, it even defies common sense. The legend is simple: the  
PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa. -- Here's a look at Groundhog Day, an American tradition that is meant to predict when spring will arrive. Facts. The groundhog emerges from its burrow on February 2. If the  
And what does February 2nd have to do with it? But Groundhog Day actually has deep roots in a much older Christian tradition. Furthermore, the day that we celebrate Groundhog's Day has some real meteorological significance, designating the halfway point between two important markers in the changing of the seasons (via EarthSky.) 
MACON, Ga. — Groundhog Day has been an annual tradition since the very first celebration was held on Feb. 2nd, 1877 in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. If the groundhog sees its shadow, there is six  
In 1993, the film Groundhog Day starring Bill Murray popularised the use of the term ‘groundhog day’ to mean something that is endlessly repeated.It also popularised the event itself: after the film came out, the crowd at Gobbler’s Knob grew from around 2,000 annual attendees to a staggering 40,000, which is nearly 8 times the population of Punxsutawney. 
An unusual, yet beloved holiday February 2nd is Groundhog Day, the day when a groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil predicts whether or not we will have six more weeks of winter. If he sees his shadow, more cold is on the way; if not, warmer weather is coming. While this holiday may seem like a silly tradition, it has a surprisingly deep history. Ancient Traditions 
The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The annual ritual has roots in pre-Christian traditions and was brought to the U.S. by  
Most of us know the tradition: on February 2, our old friend the groundhog will emerge from hibernation, come out of his den, and predict whether winter will deliver more cold weather this year. If the groundhog sees his shadow, the story goes, cold weather will persist another few weeks. If not, warm weather is around the corner. If you like the folklore of holidays, you may be interested to  
Since 1887, Groundhog Day has been an American celebration focused on a groundhog predicting the weather. Each year, thousands gather in Pennsylvania to experience the festivities. 
3. Celebrate Groundhog Day, Every Day! Culturally, seeing a groundhog often brings to mind Groundhog Day, a tradition where the groundhog’s behavior is believed to predict the arrival of spring. This cultural perception can infuse an element of hope and anticipation into your life. 4. You Need to Set Boundaries 
The problem with that flip was it didn’t really mean anything other than teasing Patriots Nation. This kid – he is only 22 – seems to have that “It” factor. Maye has a lot to learn. Looking good and winning is different. Just look at the young man on the L.A. Chargers, Justin Herbert. 
Let's look at the five-day. As you can see, nothing to be too scared about. Bundle up warm, but you can leave your galoshes at home. I won't be here for the 10:00. Tomorrow's Groundhog Day. I'll be in Punxsutawney for our country's oldest groundhog festival. According to the legend, tomorrow, February 2nd 
You know what's funny, this is actually adressed but in like the opposite direction in the VR video game sequel Groundhog Day: Like Father Like Son where its shown that Phil basically became buddha like and lived his life to the best of every day. 
“Day 2:” * “PHIL:” Well it’s Groundhog Day .. again .. “Day 21:” * “PHIL:” This is pitiful. A thousand people .. freezing their butts off waiting to worship a rat! What a hype. Groundhog Day used to mean something in this town. They used to pull the hog out and they used to EAT IT! You’re hypocrites! All of ya’! 
I think you kinda missed the point of the movie. Phil is a horrible, immoral person. He is destined to repeat the day over and over (according to the late comedy genius Harold Ramis "for 30 or 40 years") until he realizes his flaws, corrects them, and becomes a capital-G Good Person. 
Harold Ramis’s Groundhog Day turns 24 this year, and its legacy remains ongoing. Woodstock, Il’s fictional Tip Top Cafe was temporarily turned into the real Tip Top Bistro; AMC plays the movie  
I don't really know what to call it, but the voice you hear in the beginning, does it actually mean anything? Like when he says "We have had reports of violence" etc. I've played the game for a while but I still don't know if it's important or not to hear what he reports? Is it just random, or is it actually helpful for finding clues? 
“If Candlemas Day be fair and bright, Then winter will have another flight, But if it be dark with clouds and rain, Then winter is gone and will not come again." This, of course, is a Middle-ages way of stating that a dark cloudy day on Candlemas would predict a short winter, while a sunny day meant that winter would continue for some time. 
In modern times, the year’s four cross-quarter days are Groundhog Day (February 2), May Day (May 1), Lammas (August 1) and – the most sinister cross-quarter day because it comes at a dark time  </p>
