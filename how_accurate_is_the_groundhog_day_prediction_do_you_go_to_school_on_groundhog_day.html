        <p>Other Animals That Weigh In On The Forecast On Groundhog Day In determining the accuracy of Punxsutawney Phil, Noaa compared national temperatures in the six weeks after Feb. 2 over the last 10 years.

Sadly, the groundhog is often wrong when it comes to his predictions. Since making his first prediction in 1887, Punxsutawney Phil has been right 39% of the time, according to the Stormfax Weather  
However, last year's declaration of an early spring was a pretty accurate prediction. Much of the country saw above average temperatures,  Groundhog Day Forecast 2025:

Here's when Groundhog Day began: The first mention of Groundhog Day came in 1886 in Punxsutawney. Over the years, several other locations have begun using their own groundhog, including General Beauregard Lee of Atlanta, Dunkirk Dave of Dunkirk, New York, and Jimmy of Sun Prairie, Wisconsin.
