        <h2><strong>what does groundhog day really mean groundhog day heimlich maneuver</strong></h2>
        <p>The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
What does this mean? Yes, I’ve read up on and know what Groundhog Day literally is: a holiday that celebrates a quaint folk tradition of determining the seasons. But I would have thought that a metaphor or an idiom involving the day would give an indeterminate or anticipatory impression, while Jamison’s construction here makes it seem like  
A sunny Groundhog Day means cold weather is coming.  Origins of Punxsutawney Phil and why sunny weather means more winter Groundhog Day: What does a groundhog have to do  This isn't really a

Groundhog Day, in the United States and Canada, day (February 2) on which the emergence of the groundhog from its burrow is said to foretell the weather for the following six weeks. The beginning of February, which falls roughly halfway between the winter solstice and the spring equinox , has long been a significant time of the year in many  
The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The annual ritual has roots in pre-Christian traditions and was brought to the U.S. by  
In 1993, the film Groundhog Day starring Bill Murray popularised the use of the term ‘groundhog day’ to mean something that is endlessly repeated.It also popularised the event itself: after the film came out, the crowd at Gobbler’s Knob grew from around 2,000 annual attendees to a staggering 40,000, which is nearly 8 times the population of Punxsutawney. 
The diary entry says, "Last Tuesday, the 2nd, was Candlemas Day, the day on which, according to the Germans, the Groundhog peeps out of his winter quarters and if he sees his shadow he pops back  
An unusual, yet beloved holiday February 2nd is Groundhog Day, the day when a groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil predicts whether or not we will have six more weeks of winter. If he sees his shadow, more cold is on the way; if not, warmer weather is coming. While this holiday may seem like a silly tradition, it has a surprisingly deep history. Ancient Traditions 
Many years later, and we’re still looking to Punxsutawney, and, of course, its top groundhog, Phil, to indicate whether or not we should bundle up or pack away the parkas. And The Farmer’s Almanac says Phil is a crisp 130 years old, so he should be a pretty reliable source at this point. 
“If Candlemas Day be fair and bright, Then winter will have another flight, But if it be dark with clouds and rain, Then winter is gone and will not come again." This, of course, is a Middle-ages way of stating that a dark cloudy day on Candlemas would predict a short winter, while a sunny day meant that winter would continue for some time. 
Groundhog Day has a rich history based on a deeper meaning; it speaks to the triumph of spring over winter—and birth over death. Again, note the appearance of light over dark with the appearance of candles and dawn—and, of course, the spiritual light of a holier presence. 
In modern times, the year’s four cross-quarter days are Groundhog Day (February 2), May Day (May 1), Lammas (August 1) and – the most sinister cross-quarter day because it comes at a dark time  
What is Groundhog Day? What Does Groundhog Day Mean? Groundhog Day is celebrated on February 2. (In North America) According to ancient stories, if it is cloudy when the groundhog comes out of his underground home on this day, then spring will come early; if it is sunny, the groundhog will see his shadow and go back into his home, and the  
"Groundhog Day is really a holiday about sex," he adds.  INSKEEP: Of course, people give a different meaning to the emergence of Punxsutawney Phil in Pennsylvania. He is a central figure in the  
Where does the phrase ‘Groundhog Day’ come from? 
Jim Means holds up a sleepy Punxsutawney Phil at daybreak on Feb. 2, 1980. The groundhog's "Inner Circle" dresses the same today.  "Groundhog Day is really a holiday about sex," he adds. 
On Thursday, Punxsutawney Phil predicted six more weeks of winter, but Groundhog Day is about much more than predicting the timeliness of spring. News Today's news 
The legend is simple: the groundhog's shadow on Feb. 2 predicts the weather for the next six weeks, until the start of spring. A sunny day means the groundhog will see his shadow ― this is taken  
A Groundhog is a small, furry animal that looks like a mixture of a squirrel and a badger. According to the tradition, each year one of the furry creatures can predict when spring will arrive. </p>
