After a decade-long anticipation, Australia is set to witness the theatrical charm of Groundhog Day The Musical. Initially announced in 2014 by the multi-talented Australian comedian, musician, and actor Tim Minchin, known for his work in Upright, this musical adaptation of the Bill Murray classic has already captivated audiences in London and Broadway. 
A Must-See for 2024. For those wondering whether Groundhog Day The Musical is worth the hype, the answer is a resounding yes. Whether you’re a fan of the original movie, a lover of musical theatre, or someone simply looking for a unique and thought-provoking night out, this is one show that shouldn’t be missed. 
Opening Night of Groundhog Day: The Musical was a highly anticipated event for me. I am a huge Tim Minchin fan and was excited to see how his satirical comedic wit and mind-blowing musical ability would transform the popular 1990s movie through the addition of his music and lyrics. 
Groundhog Day contains flashing lights, smoke, gun shot effects &amp; some strong language. The story ends happily but has darker phases. One musical sequence in act 2 satirically portrays the central character attempting suicide four times. 
"Groundhog Day the Musical" is a theatrical adaptation of the 1993 film "Groundhog Day," featuring music and lyrics by Tim Minchin and a book by Danny Rubin. The musical made its Broadway debut in 2017. 
Critically acclaimed on both the West End and Broadway, Groundhog Day revels in one man's journey of self-discovery, day after day. Inspired by the hilarious film starring Bill Murray, Groundhog Day features a book by original co-screenwriter Dan Rubin, and music and lyrics by Tony Award-winner Tim Minchin (Matilda the Musical). 
Groundhog Day the Musical has ended it’s 13-week season at Melbourne’s Princess Theatre. Phil Connors, a cynical Pittsburgh TV weatherman is sent to cover the annual Groundhog Day event in the small town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. Caught in a time loop, he’s forced to relive the same day again and again and again.

As he navigates the repetitive day with humor and wit, Phil discovers that true change comes from within. Featuring catchy songs by Tim Minchin, the composer of MATILDA The Musical, sharp comedy, and a poignant message about redemption and love, this musical is a delightful celebration of second chances and self-discovery. 
It's Groundhog Day The Musical — and it's finally making its way to the Australian stages ten years after it was first announced.Back in 2014, Australian comedian, musician, actor and writer Tim Minchin revealed that he was making a song-filled onstage version of the Bill Murray-starring classic comedy.
