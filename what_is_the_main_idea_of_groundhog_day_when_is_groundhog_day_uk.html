        <p>Clymer Freas (1867–1942) [m] who was city editor at the Punxsutawney Spirit is credited as the "father" who conceived the idea of "Groundhog Day". [ 37 ] [ n ] It has also been suggested that Punxsutawney was where all the Groundhog Day events originated, from where it spread to other parts of the United States and Canada. 
Groundhog Day, in the United States and Canada, day (February 2) on which the emergence of the groundhog from its burrow is said to foretell the weather for the following six weeks. In the United States the most popular event occurs in Pennsylvania and centers on a groundhog designated Punxsutawney Phil.

The Groundhog Day tradition came to North America from German settlers in Pennsylvania. The celebration dates back to Candlemas Day , a Christian holiday observed on February 2nd. 
America has been looking to Punxsutawney Phil for over 130 years to indicate whether or not we'll have a short or long winter. But Groundhog Day goes back way further than that. Here's the complete history of the holiday, as well as when it is and how Punxsutawney Phil came to be. 
Groundhog Day is a tradition that takes place every year on February 2.Prompted by members of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club—who dress up in top hats and tuxedos for the ceremony—Punxsutawney Phil emerges from a special burrow in Gobbler's Knob, a rural park nestled just outside of the small town of Punxsutawney.
