        <p>It's 6 am. Rise and shine. And don't forget your booties 'cause it's cold out there today. It's cold out there every day. What is this, Miami Beach? 
The times referenced below are based on a digital copy of the movie and should be a good approximation of the times the clock appears. While the movie's official run time is 1 hour and 42 minutes, I timed it at no more than 1 hr 37 minutes. Scene One: (7:17) Clock flips from 5:59 to 6:00 am - Phil wakes to Sonny and Cher's I Got You Babe ("Then  
By the time their run of collaborations ended prematurely with 1993’s Groundhog Day, however, their ambition had risen in perfect unison with their singularly complementary talents. With Meatballs, Caddyshack , and Stripes, Ramis and Murray clearly just wanted to make movies that were funny and entertaining and made a lot of money. 
Somehow, these weighty topics get weaved through many hilarious moments, thanks largely to the efforts of star Bill Murray.For Murray, Groundhog Day proved his acting skills could take on broader  
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
The script for Groundhog Day was adjusted between Danny Rubin’s first pass and Ramis’s revisions; originally, Phil was supposed to be stuck in his repetitive hell for 10,000 years. 
For Connors, Groundhog Day begins each morning at 6:00 A.M., when he wakes up in his room in a Victorian bed and breakfast. His clock radio is always playing the same song, "I Got You Babe" by Sonny &amp; Cher. His memories of the "previous" day are intact, but he is trapped in a seemingly endless time loop, repeating the same day in the same small

Initially devastated, Phil finds wild joy in his own impunity within the looping time. However, after a few of these same Groundhog Days in Punxsutawney, the cynical weather forecaster does everything he can to avoid waking up every day to the same radio song, I Got You Babe by Sonny and Cher. Yet, even dozens of suicides cruelly end with him  
In 1993's "Groundhog Day," Bill Murray's character was awakened every morning at 6 o'clock sharp by an alarm clock radio playing "I Got You Babe." He got to live the same day over and over again, babe. 
Here we go again, and again, and again. One of the running gags of the endlessly repeating loop of Bill Murray’s 90s film Groundhog Day features beleaguered weatherman Phil Conners waking up each day to Sonny and Cher’s 1965 oldies hit I Got You Babe, followed by this ‘chilling’ quote: “OK, campers, rise and shine, and don’t forget your booties, cause it’s cold out there.

"I Got You Babe" is a song performed by American pop and entertainment duo Sonny &amp; Cher and written by Sonny Bono. It was the first single taken from their debut studio album, Look at Us (1965). In August 1965, the single spent three weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States [ 3 ] where it sold more than one million  
In Groundhog Day, "I Got You Babe" serves as Phil Connors' radio alarm in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania's Cherry Tree Inn, with each repetition of his time loop opening around the song's halfway point and transitioning into banter by the radio hosts. The song seems endearing and naïve upon its initial use, but with each loop Phil's reaction
