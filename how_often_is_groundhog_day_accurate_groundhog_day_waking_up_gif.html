        <h2><strong>how often is groundhog day accurate groundhog day movie lore</strong></h2>
        <p>Although he is not the most accurate seasonal prognosticator, we would be remiss not to honor the longest-running weather-forecasting groundhog in the United States, Punxsutawney Phil. A beloved national celebrity, legend has it that he has been prophesying when spring would arrive from his burrow on Gobler’s Knob since 1887. 
NOAA released a study of Groundhog Day predictions and found Punxsutawney Phil to be the 17th most accurate groundhog in the United States. 
groundhog day isn’t just one day for the city’s groundhog club. it’s marked by a multi day celebration that even includes a groundhog ball. and this year will be extra special day for phil, as it’s his first groundhog day as a father here in alabama. it’s a sand mountain sam who’s often going to steal the spotlight. 
If Lander Lil "sees" a shadow on Groundhog Day, then more winter is expected. How Punxsutawney Phil fared Overall, 14 of the groundhogs had 50% accuracy or better.

Records kept by the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club show Phil has predicted 108 continued winters and only 20 early springs as of 2024. According to the Stormfax Almanac, that works out to a 39%  
Groundhog Day celebrations around the country. Each year, Phil draws about 20,000 people to the Groundhog Day celebration at Gobbler’s Knob in the Pennsylvania Wilds outside of Punxsutawney  
More often than not, Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow, a sign of more winter.  Are Phil's Groundhog Day predictions accurate? Punxsutawney Phil is a groundhog, not a meteorologist. Between  
Sadly, the groundhog is often wrong when it comes to his predictions. Since making his first prediction in 1887, Punxsutawney Phil has been right 39% of the time, according to the Stormfax Weather  
Punxsutawney Phil's process for predicting spring hasn't changed much in the past 137 years. The Punxsutawney Groundhog Club takes care of Phil year-round, and on each Feb. 2, members of the club  
Here's the forecast for Sunday morning: Cloudy conditions and chilly temperatures in the upper-20s are expected in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania when Phil makes his prediction around 7:08 a.m. ET  
For Phil to be more accurate, he needs to see his shadow more. Seeing his shadow signals six weeks until spring. Of the last 20 years, 17 were warmer than average. 
Why is Groundhog Day celebrated every year on February 2? Groundhog Day is a beloved tradition for many as they wait to see how long winter will last. As the legend goes, if Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow, he predicts six more weeks of winter. If he doesn't, it's a forecast of an early spring. 
Groundhog Day events often include music, food, and games, making it a fun-filled day for families. Some schools and communities hold educational programs to teach children about groundhogs and the history of Groundhog Day. 
In 1979, the Ohio legislature named him the official groundhog for the Buckeye State, per Groundhog-Day.com. How accurate is Phil? How accurate is Chuck? 
The Groundhog Day gathering has become a cornerstone event in Punxsutawney, which has marked the occasion every year since mention of the holiday first appeared in 1886 in the local newspaper  
Groundhog Day is almost here: What to know about the rodent, the shadow, and the weather Punxsutawney Phil is the most famous weather-predicting rodent, but he apparently isn't the most accurate. 
PUNXSUTAWNEY, Penn. - Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania is the Mecca for those around the country celebrating Groundhog Day. Every year, on Feb. 2, tens of thousands of people flock to this small town of less than 6,000 people some 80 miles northeast of Pittsburgh, to see whether the town's rodent  
Which groundhog is more accurate? By the numbers: According to a 2022 study by FiveThirtyEight.com , Beau boasts a 63% accuracy rate for predictions from 2012 to 2021, outshining Phil’s 45.5%.
