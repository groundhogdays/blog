        <p>Review at a glance.  improved musical version of Groundhog Day again.  it’s fitting that Broadway actor Andy Karl is back in the role of Phil Connors at the Old Vic, where he and the show  
If any show was tailor-made for repeat viewings, it’s Groundhog Day.It’s not just the inspired time-loop premise of Danny Rubin’s tale – first seen in his 1993 existential romcom movie, then in this stage musical adaptation with Tim Minchin for the Old Vic in 2016 – but the extraordinary intricacy of both writing and staging, which mean that each encounter with it reveals new wonders. 
If this production doesn’t end up with a long run in the West End (and it should), it would make a great alternative to the Old Vic’s annual Groundhog Day-like repeat of A Christmas Carol. Groundhog Day The Musical can be seen at The Old Vic in London until 19 August 2023. Paul was given a complimentary review ticket. 
Review of Tim Minchins Groundhog Day musical at The Old Vic, London starring Andy Karl and Tanisha Spring. After 7 years, Tim Minchins musical returns to London in a show that feels refreshingly familiar. 
“Groundhog Day” premiered at the Old Vic in 2016, and went on to win a slew of awards. Fittingly for a musical about a man who finds himself living the same day over and over, it is back at  
There’s more than a whiff of familiarity down at London’s Waterloo at the moment; Olivier award-winning Groundhog Day is back at the Old Vic and so is Andy Karl, playing the sneering  
The musical adaptation proved a hit with London audiences back then, but the New York run was short and it never transferred to the West End as promised. Take two, then, and see what a second go achieves! I didn’t see Groundhog Day at the Old Vic back then. More fool me, I don’t know what I was doing in 2016 that prevented me. 
Reviews are coming in for the Olivier Award-winning musical Groundhog Day at The Old Vic theatre in London.. With music and lyrics by Tim Minchin (Matilda The Musical), and direction by Matthew Warchus, Groundhog Day has a book by Danny Ruben, who co-wrote the screenplay of the original movie, which starred Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell.

Their new musical Groundhog Day is a cast-iron triumph, both joyful and profound, incredibly funny and seriously moving. Danny Rubin’s book follows the lineaments of his 1993 film (directed by Harold Ramis and starring Bill Murray ) but the production intelligently reimagines and remixes the ingredients for the stage. 
Stephen Sondheim reportedly once toyed with the idea of turning Groundhog Day into a musical, but he thought its apparently static narrative presented insoluble problems. 
Existential angst and toe-tapping tunes blend miraculously well in ‘Groundhog Day’, composer Tim Minchin's dazzling take on the 1993 movie. 
Groundhog Day Musical, Old Vic Theatre 2016 review: ★★★★★ Back off Broadway, we might just have the best new musical since Hamilton – right here in London. A new day has dawned for hit 1993 film Groundhog Day. It brings a songbook bursting with instant classics and even a touch of tap dancing.

Danny Rubin’s book follows the lineaments of his 1993 film (directed by Harold Ramis and starring Bill Murray ) but the production intelligently reimagines and remixes the ingredients for the stage. 
Seven years after its premiere, the Groundhog Day musical is back at the Old Vic. Andy Karl is still playing cynical weatherman Phil Connors, condemned to relive a single day over and over. And I still love it. 
Groundhog Day, appropriately, is back where it started. The hit film about a TV weatherman’s endlessly reiterated day in small-town USA moved to the Old Vic stage in 2016; but then its progress became bumpy, despite the awards showered on it and its lead, Andy Karl, on both sides of the Atlantic. Karl was injured during a Broadway preview and the show's US tour didn't happen. 
It tells the story of Phil Connors, an arrogant Pittsburgh TV weatherman who, during an assignment covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, [1] finds himself in a time loop, repeating the same day again and again. [2] The musical made its world premiere at The Old Vic in London in summer 2016 and was nominated for  
On paper, the happy new musical “Groundhog Day,” which opened on Tuesday night at the Old Vic Theater here, seemed like one of those shows that elicit instant groans of “been there, done
