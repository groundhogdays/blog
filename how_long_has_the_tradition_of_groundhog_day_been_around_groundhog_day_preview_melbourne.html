        <p>The Groundhog Day celebrations of the 1880s were carried out by the Punxsutawney Elks Lodge. The lodge members were the "genesis" of the Groundhog Club formed later, which continued the Groundhog Day tradition. But the lodge started out being interested in the groundhog as a game animal for food. It had started to serve groundhog at the lodge  
The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The annual ritual has roots in pre-Christian traditions and was brought to the U.S. by  
MACON, Ga. — Groundhog Day has been an annual tradition since the very first celebration was held on Feb. 2nd, 1877 in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. If the groundhog sees its shadow, there is six  
Crowds as large as 30,000 have turned out to Punxsutawney for multi-day Groundhog Day festivities, which the state calls a significant tourism boost for the town of fewer than 6,000 people. 
In Punxsutawney, 1886 marked the first time that Groundhog Day appeared in the local newspaper. The following year brought the first official trek to Gobbler’s Knob. Each year since then has seen a steady increase in participation of the celebration from people all over the world. 
The Enduring Appeal of Groundhog Day. Despite its roots in superstition and folklore, Groundhog Day has endured as a beloved tradition for over 130 years. Its popularity speaks to the human need for levity, hope, and communal celebration, especially during the long, dark days of winter.

Crowds as large as 30,000 have turned out to Punxsutawney for multi-day Groundhog Day festivities, which the state calls a significant tourism boost for the town of fewer than 6,000 people. The ceremony itself — which returned to the stage in 2022 after a COVID-19 hiatus — features dancers, music, speeches and visitors from around the world. 
An unusual, yet beloved holiday February 2nd is Groundhog Day, the day when a groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil predicts whether or not we will have six more weeks of winter. If he sees his shadow, more cold is on the way; if not, warmer weather is coming. While this holiday may seem like a silly tradition, it has a surprisingly deep history. Ancient Traditions 
Groundhog Day fans aren’t able to arrive at the official “Gobbler’s Knob” grounds until they open at 3 a.m. ET. Since the holiday has evolved over time, Groundhog Day activities don’t just end after Phil makes his predictions. In fact, celebratory events continue throughout the rest of the week — including the Groundhog Ball on Feb. 3. 
PUNXSUTAWNEY, Penn. - Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania is the Mecca for those around the country celebrating Groundhog Day. Every year, on Feb. 2, tens of thousands of people flock to this small town of less than 6,000 people some 80 miles northeast of Pittsburgh, to see whether the town's rodent  
According to Groundhog Club members, there has only been one Phil and he has been predicting since 1887, making him 135 years old. His longevity is credited to drinking “the elixir of life,” a

Groundhog Day is on its way and if Punxsutawney Phil or Michigan's Woody the Woodchuck don't see their shadows this year, we could see an early spring, the folk tale says. Since the 1800s, Groundhog Day has been observed on Feb. 2. The longstanding tradition calls for the fur-bearing weather  
Groundhog Day, in the United States and Canada, day (February 2) on which the emergence of the groundhog from its burrow is said to foretell the weather for the following six weeks. In the United States the most popular event occurs in Pennsylvania and centers on a groundhog designated Punxsutawney Phil. 
Groundhog Day began as a tiny event and has grown into an American holiday we can all be proud of. Its furry, buck-toothed star, Punxsutawney Phil, has visited the White House and even met Oprah.

Excellent Diggers – Did you know groundhogs can dig tunnels up to 66 feet long? Their underground homes even have separate rooms, like a little groundhog apartment. Recommended Groundhog Day Books.
