        <p>The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records.

This was a

Whether you‘re a true believer in Phil‘s prognosticating powers or simply enjoy the spectacle of it all, there‘s no denying the charm and humor of Groundhog Day. So this February 2nd, join the crowds at Gobbler‘s Knob (or tune in from the comfort of your own burrow) and raise a toast to Punxsutawney Phil, the weather-predicting wonder.

Most of us know the tradition: on February 2, our old friend the groundhog will emerge from hibernation, come out of his den, and predict whether winter will deliver more cold weather this year. If the groundhog sees his shadow, the story goes, cold weather will persist another few weeks. If not, warm weather is around the corner. If you like the folklore of holidays, you may be interested to  
An unusual, yet beloved holiday February 2nd is Groundhog Day, the day when a groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil predicts whether or not we will have six more weeks of winter. If he sees his shadow, more cold is on the way; if not, warmer weather is coming. While this holiday may seem like a silly tradition, it has a surprisingly deep history. Ancient Traditions 
"The best known Groundhog Day ceremony occurs each year in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania."  "Punxsutawney Phil is the only true weather forecasting groundhog. The others are just impostors." 
Groundhog Day is a holiday celebrated in the United States and Canada on February 2, each year. In weather lore, if a groundhog emerges from its burrow on this day and fails to see its shadow because the weather is cloudy, winter will soon end.

A Pittsburgh weatherman on assignment in Punxsutawney gets stuck in a comic time-warp and must experience the same Groundhog Day, over and over again. Subtitles : English Starring : Bill Murray Andie MacDowell Chris Elliott Stephen Tobolowsky Brian Doyle-Murray 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
At first, Harold Ramis’ GROUNDHOG DAY seems like a typical Bill Murray comedy with the iconic leading man standing one step away from the rest of humanity, always quick with an ironic insult.
