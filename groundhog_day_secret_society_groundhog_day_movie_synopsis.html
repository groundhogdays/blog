        <p>The Groundhog Club’s Inner Circle is a group of local dignitaries responsible for carrying on the tradition of Groundhog Day every year. They’re the ones who are not only responsible for planning the events every year, but they’re also responsible for the feeding and care of Phil himself! 
Home of Punxsutawney Phil in the Weather Capital of the World. The Punxsutawney Groundhog Club invites to to celebrate Groundhog Day! 
The Punxsutawney Groundhog Club Inner Circle is comprised of 15 members whose task it is to protect and perpetuate the legend of the great weather-predicting groundhog Punxsutawney Phil. The club was formed in the 1880’s, and as the legend of Punxsutawney Phil grew, so too did the ceremony that honors him every February 2nd at Gobblers Knob. 
That’s right, woodchuck-chuckers. It’s Groundhog Day. And it’s a special one. The birth of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, custodians of famed weather prognosticator Punxsutawney Phil, was  
No, this is not some shadowy cabal of groundhog breeders. Instead, this tuxedo-wearing, top-hatted group who perform this annual rite of seasonal observance are called the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, or the Inner Circle of Groundhog Day, according to Smithsonian Magazine. This civic society has remained intact since it all began in the late

The man whispered to the groundhog in their secret, shared language, what he calls “Groundhogese” And, for the 130 th year since 1886, Punxsutawney Phil, the most famous rodent this side of a certain mouse named Mickey, predicted the weather. Happy Groundhog Day. 
Since Phil officially works only one day a year, he spends the other 364 days in Phil’s Burrow, a warm terrarium built into the Punxsutawney library. The wall that faces the outside is made of glass, so visitors can pay their respects and see Phil relaxing on his days off – usually a chubby, snoring heap, sprawled upside down. 
But every February 2, the groundhog and his handlers - known as the "Inner Circle" - have their day. Thousands of people travel to Punsxutawney annually to witness Phil's Groundhog Day weather  
Groundhog Day originated from an ancient European tradition called Candlemas Day, where clergy would bless candles and distribute them to ward off the darkness of winter. The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania.

Groundhog Day holds a secret, more concealed than any subterranean stove -- the groundhog represents humanity, as we confront a profoundly uncertain future. From time to time, we contemplate our prospects, like the animal emerging from its burrow. 
Before you take the trip over to Pennsylvania for Groundhog Day festivities there, you should at least know a little bit about Punxsutawney Phil, especially if you want to see if he sees his shadow.

Whether Gordy the groundhog predicts an early spring or six more weeks of winter, we predict he will be cute this Groundhog Day. If he sees his shadow, that means six more weeks of winter. 
The movie’s twist comes on February 2. Phil wakes up at 6:00 a.m. He goes through his day and at the end of it, turns in for the night. He wakes up in the morning and, to his disbelief, the day  
Groundhog Day got a resurgence of popularity in 1993 when the film of the same name came out. Groundhog Day stars Bill Murray as Phil, of course, who finds himself living the same day in repeat after visiting Punxsutawney to report on their groundhog and if he sees his shadow or not. The movie was inspired by a book about vampires

Groundhog Day: The Musical, based on the classic Bill Murray film comedy, is the story of Phil Connors (Alex Syiek, center), a cynical TV weatherman stuck in a never-ending nightmare in a small town whose claim to fame is meteorologist groundhog Punxsutawney Phil. Paramount Theatre’s Midwest regional premiere of Groundhog Day: The Musical runs through March 13, 2022. </p>
