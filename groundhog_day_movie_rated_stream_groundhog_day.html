This is one of Murray's most iconic roles. He shines in Groundhog Day, a mostly good-natured comedy that delivers lots of laughs and honest sentiment. Funny and sweet, the film has the right blend of comedy and romance. Although Phil isn't a particularly admirable character, the movie manages to make us care about him.

Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
Groundhog Day: Directed by Harold Ramis. With Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliott, Stephen Tobolowsky. A narcissistic, self-centered weatherman finds himself in a time loop on Groundhog Day. 
For a 90's PG movie the language is exceptionally mild and soft. The comedic suicide scenes are meant to prove a lesson to the main character. They are comedic and exaggerated and actually have an anti-suicide message in that the main character has to re-live Groundhog Day until he becomes a nicer, more decent person. 
Teamed with a relentlessly cheerful producer (Andie MacDowell) and a smart-aleck cameraman (Chris Elliott), TV weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is sent to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities. But on his way out of town, Phil is caught in a giant blizzard, which he failed to predict, and finds himself stuck in small-town hell. Just when things couldn't

At first, Harold Ramis’ GROUNDHOG DAY seems like a typical Bill Murray comedy with the iconic leading man standing one step away from the rest of humanity, always quick with an ironic insult. But the film cleverly turns Murray’s sarcastic outsider persona against him and the film evolves into a sweet fable about humanity. 
It's a great movie but I think Bill murray has to be the most over rated not funny or good actors ever.  Movies Like Groundhog Day; Top Posts Reddit . reReddit

The movie is basically a comedy, but there’s an underlying dynamic that is a little more thoughtful. Like “Scrooged,” Murray’s dreary 1988 film, this is a movie about a grouch in the process of self-redemption: A supernatural force is showing him his weaknesses.
