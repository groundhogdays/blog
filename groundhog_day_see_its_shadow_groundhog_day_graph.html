Conversely, if the groundhog does not see its shadow, an early spring is anticipated. The origins of this custom are steeped in a blend of cultural practices and natural observations. Groundhog Day has its roots in ancient European traditions, where the behavior of hibernating animals was used as a guide for predicting the weather.
