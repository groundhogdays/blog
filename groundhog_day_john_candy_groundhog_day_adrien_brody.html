        <p>According to the director, this frame implies that Groundhog Day and the movie Cool Runnings (1993) are in the same cinematic universe. In fact, the reason the Jamaican bobsled team is so talented in Cool Runnings is because they got so much practice by repeating that day over and over. This is made possible because both movies were released in

Murray, John Candy and Steve Martin are the three guys who pop into my head as guys who made asshole characters likeable. I was watching some of Planes, Trains and Automobiles and remembered as a kid how I thought Del was an asshole but was shocked how I grew to be fond of him so that his revelation at the end broke my heart.

Groundhog Day: Directed by Harold Ramis. With Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliott, Stephen Tobolowsky. A narcissistic, self-centered weatherman finds himself in a time loop on Groundhog Day.

John Franklin Candy (October 31, 1950 – March 4, 1994) [1] was a Canadian actor and comedian who is best known for his work in Hollywood films. Candy first rose to national prominence in the 1970s as a member of the Toronto branch of the Second City and its SCTV sketch comedy series . 
“John Belushi was really a great actor. He had enormous talent,” continued Murray. He also added that Candy “was fun and also a good actor.” Murray also talked about SNL’s Canadian counterpart, Second City Television (SCTV) that ran between 1976 and 1984. The satirical sketch comedy based on a fictional television station began as a  
The Ghostbusters and Caddyshack screenwriter was peerless in his ability to craft vehicles around the unique talents of their stars, most notably Bill Murray in Meatballs, Stripes, Ghostbusters and Groundhog Day but Armed &amp; Dangerous fatally misunderstands the nature of John Candy’s appeal. 
Stripes, a military film from 1981 with Harold Ramis and John Candy, was directed by Ivan Reitman and has a 6.8 rating from IMDb. Ghost Busters from 1984 was also directed by Ivan Reitman and features Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, who jointly wrote the imaginative script, and Sigourney Weaver.

Hudgins already had been to Woodstock to film a scene from 1987’s “Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles,” starring John Candy and Steve Martin, near the Old Courthouse on the Woodstock Square. He’d also worked on 1989’s “Field of Dreams” with Kevin Costner – another film with a famous location often visited by fans, this one in Dubuque  
For Murray, Groundhog Day proved his acting skills could take on broader depth, something he'd further showcase in films like Rushmore (1998), The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) and Lost in Translation  
Members of that iconic cast reunited for the first time to mark 31 years since the film was released. But Friday was about honoring Harold Ramis and commemor 
It’s Groundhog Day — again — and you can’t think of the holiday without Bill Murray.  Add the charm of John Candy and you have a comedy classic by Ivan Reitman three years before he did  
John Candy stars in the 1989 comedy Uncle Buck, directed by John Hughes, which showcases Candy's remarkable ability to bring warmth and humor to a character.The film follows the misadventures of the titular Uncle Buck, an unreliable but lovable bachelor who's tasked with taking care of his nieces and nephew while their parents are away. 
I’ll take Harold Ramis’ body of work over Mel Brooks any day, he seriously dwarfs him. Wrote or co-wrote Animal House, Caddyshack, Stripes, Ghost Busters, Groundhog Day, plus another dozen. Directed Caddyshack, Vacation, Groundhog Day, Analyze This, plus another bunch. Wrote and starred in SCTV. 
He was a Chicago actor who starred with everyone from Chuck Norris in Equinox (1985) to Stockard Channing in Meet the Applegates (1990) to John Candy in Only the Lonely (1991). His last movie role was that of the homeless elderly gentleman befriended by Bill Murray in the film Groundhog Day (1993). 
In 'Stripes', John Winger (Murray) loses everything that matters to him - his car, apartment and girlfriend - on the same day. Along with his equally unsuccessful best friend, Russell Zitsky (Harold Ramis), John decides to enrol in the US Army, but discovers that his unit is little more than a refuge for drug-addled, psychotic misfits.
