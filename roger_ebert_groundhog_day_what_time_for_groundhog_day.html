The movie, as everyone knows, is about a man who finds himself living the same day over and over and over again. He is the only person in his world who knows this is happening, and after going through periods of dismay and bitterness, revolt and despair, suicidal self-destruction and cynical recklessness, he begins to do something that is alien to his nature.

• Introduction to The Great Movies III You'd be surprised how many people have told me they're working their way through my books of Great Movies one film at a time.
