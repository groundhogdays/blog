        <p>Groundhog Day; Drinking; Post-Episode: s08e06 Confessions (9-1-1 TV) Fix-It of Sorts; Summary. When Tommy's alarm goes off the next day, he does not press snooze. He immediately rolls over and picks up his phone. Wednesday. Fuck. He's seen Groundhog Day almost as many times as he's seen Top Gun, he knows how this goes. 
This fanfic is heavily based off of the visual novel "Missed Messages"  Groundhog Day - Minchin/Rubin (5) Marvel Cinematic Universe (4) Edge of Tomorrow (2014) (2) 
This "List" consists of Harry Potter or Naruto Stories based on the idea of GroundHog's Day. Infinitly looping day, week, month or year etc. Fiction Rating: All (? 
Based on the 1993 movie "Groundhog Day". Phil Connors finds himself living February 2 over and over in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. At the end of the movie he's a better man, but maybe he needed a helping hand to set him on the road to self-improvement. I don't own these characters or a groundhog, but I've had a chinchilla before. 
Groundhog Day. Harry get stuck repeating the day of the Yule Ball over and over. Watch as he learns, grows, and goes a little insane, all while trying to have some fun. Harry/Multi. Characters aged up, Harry is 18. 
"Phil, come on! Groundhog Day? February 2nd?" "That's today?" "You should know!" Rita quipped. "Why didn't you say something? Oh no, this is terrible! We're going to miss the festival!" Rita watched in amusement as Phil scurried around the bedroom, opening the closet doors , flinging clothes everywhere. "What am I going to wear? Rita, help. me!" 
"With all due respect, Agent Romanov, it's been a VERY long day." My Hero Academia. Bakugou's Week from Hell. Mature, Graphic Depictions Of Violence, Major Character Death, Gen Words: 20k+, Complete Summary: Bakugou dies during the sludge villain attack and ends up in a time loop of that day. It seems simple: survive the day and break the loop.

and how about those groundhog day loops; basically it's groundhog day; but less groundhog day; Cheap Knock-Off Groundhog Day; Day Repeating Itself; Events Repeating; groudhog day; Ground Hog's Day; Groundhog Day (If You Squint) Groundhog Day (Kind of) Groundhog Day (Or Perhaps Groundhog Rites) Groundhog Day but like 800 years too early  
Also, there's Wastelands of Time, plus HP &amp; the Temporal Beacon, both of which involve a "groundhog day" like time loop. The former is Harry/Fleur and complete, the latter is H/Hr and abandoned, IIRC. Sorry I have no links, I'm on mobile atm. 
"Groundhog Day at Hogwarts" February 2 Ron Weasley was happily enjoying the comfort of his four poster bed when he was suddenly woke by his best friend, "Ron wake up, we're gonna be late for breakfast, it's 8:30" said Harry.

They first met on Groundhog Day when they were six and confessed their feelings on New Year's Eve ten years later. Every Holiday comes once a year but luckily Abby and Chester has a lifetime to spend together. 
The day might be a rerun, but it was up to him to change the ending. Kaito slipped down the creaking staircase, ignoring the innkeeper's call to grab breakfast before heading out. The memory of that so-called "meal"—a thin, cold soup that tasted like murky dishwater—was still too fresh in his mind. 
Harry woke up late that morning and paused. "Ron is going to groan in three seconds," Harry said to himself. "And then he's going to pass gas." Harry blinked in surprise when the events happened the same way they had the day before . . . and the day before that. "Morning Harry," Neville said with a yawn. "What do you . . ." 
Turned out B and C had been initially looping until one accidentally pulled A in and she created a localised groundhog day for herself by constantly dying, so they never remembered those new loops (until they each respectively died in subsequent loops before she could and they realised she had way more knowledge than she should have had). 
Interesting to note that, for whatever reason, Groundhog Day style time loops are much less popular in Harry Potter fanfic than Peggy Sue second chance stories. With a name like mine, I really should have written one by now 
Both Harry and Hermione turned to stare at Ron, who looked at them defensively and shrugged ‘You have to go with Diggory and make sure he survives.’Harry/Cedric - Groundhog day AU Site : Archive of Our Own | Fandom : Harry Potter - J.

Groundhog Day. It was the heat of the moment; telling me what your heart meant! Sasuke stretched as he sat up in bed and glanced at his clock. It was Tuesday 10th December and he had a good feeling about that day. He got out of bed and slipped on a thick navy-blue jumper and a pair of dark blue jeans. </p>
