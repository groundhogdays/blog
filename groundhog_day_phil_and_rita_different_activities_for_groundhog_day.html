Throughout this classic, Phil desperately tries to win the heart and affections of Rita before the day ends and he has to restart it all again, but is always rejected no matter how hard he tries, and no matter how much he gets Rita to like him. Then on the last day of the time-loop, Phil does a bunch of good deeds to a plethora of townsfolk  
Rita the deuteragonist, from the 1993 comedy, Groundhog Day. She is the love interest of Phil Connors. Rita works with Phil at the start of the movie. Rita is a news producer, while Phil is the weatherman. The two are given an assignment where they have to go to Punxsutawney, PA, and cover the Groundhog Day festival they have there. Although Phil always had a slight crush on Rita, she at first  
Phil and Rita leave the party together, and Phil sculpts Rita out of the snow. They return to Phil’s motel, and the next morning comes. To Phil’s surprise, Rita is still with him, and it is indeed a new day, February 3rd, not Groundhog Day. Overjoyed, Phil realizes this and walks out of the motel, holding Rita’s hand, ready to welcome a

Rita rides in the weather van with Phil to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. They argue about whether the Groundhog Festival there is dumb or nice. Rita thinks it's a nice wholesome event for nice wholesome people. Once Phil realizes he's reliving Groundhog Day over and over, he eventually spends his time trying to get Rita into bed. 
It's only after Phil has spent an entire day acting like Rita that he is able to win her heart and escape the endless cycle of Groundhog Days. Rita is without doubt the moral center of this movie, a person who is kind to others and who always puts their happiness above her own.

Groundhog Day is a 1993 fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin, and starring Bill Murray.Known for massively popularizing the time loop trope (to the extent that it's referred to on this site as the "Groundhog Day" Loop), cementing its namesake day into the modern lexicon as a stand-in for an unpleasant, repetitive situation, and serving as a

The original ending of the movie Groundhog Day was intended to have Phil and Rita get married and choose to stay in Punxsutawney.
