Phil explicitly admits this, and the spell's broken. I know of others' points that Rita was at the centre of it all, but I don't think she was that crucial, I'd rather say it had more to do with the groundhog and its shadow; the last day was the one that Phil didn't see his shadow. 
Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is an arrogant Pittsburg weatherman who looks down on everyone around him and treats his coworkers poorly. His least favorite part of the year is when the network sends him to cover Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, so when he finds he's stuck in an endlessly repeating Groundhog Day, it's a living nightmare. 
Bill Murray's role as Phil Connors in 1993's Groundhog Day is one for the ages, especially considering he hated his experience behind-the-scenes just as much as his character did onscreen!

The 1993 Harold Ramis comedy "Groundhog Day" may not have spawned the hero-caught-in-a-time-loop genre, but it certainly prodded it to life.To this day, the film carries a 97% rating from critics  
Analysis of Phil Connors' Transformation Phil's Initial State. At the outset of "Groundhog Day," Phil Connors epitomizes a self-absorbed, egotistical individual who remains ensnared by his appetitive soul. He leads a life characterized by narcissism and self-righteousness, with little regard for others or their feelings.

No matter what he does, every day starts the same way – in his hotel room in Punxsutawney on February 2 nd, Groundhog Day. He can’t imagine a worse place to be stuck. There are only fourteen bars, the weather is terrible, and he can’t escape the worshipping of that dirty, dirty rodent.

To punish Connors for his hubris, Punxsutawney Phil summoned a freak storm to trap him in his domain, then looped time until Connors learned his lesson. Remember, it's not until Phil Connors delivers his sincere monologue on the beauty of Groundhog Day that his curse is lifted. 
It's possible that he died in the blizzard on the first day of the loop, but it might have also been an earthly miracle - he'll never really know.
