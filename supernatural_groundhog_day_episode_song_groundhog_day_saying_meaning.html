        <p>Episode 11 • Mystery Spot + Song. Heat Of The Moment. Asia. Add time.  Listen to every song from S3E11 - Supernatural, "Mystery Spot", with scene descriptions  
Mystery Spot is the 11th episode of Season 3. It premiered on February 14th, 2008. Sam and Dean investigate the disappearance of a man who went missing at a tourist location. While searching the site, Dean is shot and killed by the owner. Sam is devastated but stunned when he wakes up the next morning to find Dean alive and well. As the day unfolds, Sam realizes he is re-living the previous  
Sam tries to explain that they're living the same day over and over. (From the Season 3 episode "Mystery Spot")Watch Supernatural on TNT weekdays starting at 
Dean: Like Groundhog Day. Groundhog Day was a 1993 movie starring Bill Murray, where his character relives the same day over and over. Other references to Groundhog Day include Sam waking to the same song every morning, though in Groundhog Day the song is "I Got You Babe" by Sonny and Cher. 
Supernatural season 3 episode "Mystery Spot" is a perfect parody of Groundhog Day, especially with its use of Asia's "Heat Of The Moment." Supernatural arrived in 2005 and follows the Winchester brothers Dean (Jensen Ackles) and Sam (Jared Padalecki). They hunt evil creatures and other supernatural foes, with the first season focusing on their

Mystery Spot: Directed by Kim Manners. With Jared Padalecki, Jensen Ackles, Jim Beaver, Richard Speight Jr.. Sam relives the same day over and over, continually having to deal with Dean's death. 
Like "Groundhog Day". SAM Yes, exactly. Like "Groundhog Day". DEAN, nodding Uh-huh. SAM So you don't believe me. DEAN (laughs) It's just a little crazy, I mean even for us crazy, you know, like, uh— SAM Dingo ate my baby crazy? DEAN How'd you know I was going to say that? SAM Because you said it before, Dean, that's my whole point. DORIS

Season three's "Mystery Spot" gave fans a tasty slice of Groundhog Day fun, as seen through the eyes of Sam Winchester. He awoke each morning to the sound of this classic tune, as he relived the  
Where can I find the score that plays during "Sam's Macho Montage"? Something online said it was called "Holy Full Metal Jacket Sam" or something, but I can't find it anywhere. 
Season 3, Episode 11. Any show that's been on the air as long as Supernatural has to do an obligatory Groundhog Day episode, and that's "Mystery Spot.". Another one of the Trickster's ploys, Sam is forced to watch Dean perish over and over again as he relives the same day and fails to save his brother time and again. 
I always love these episodes. The bottle episodes where a character or characters are trapped in a time loop and have to find a way out. I can only think of a couple, and was looking for more. Xfiles: Monday (s6e14) Supernatural: Mystery Spot (s3e11) Star Trek NG: Cause and Effect (s5e18) 
While this premise can often be labeled gimmicky, a good script can make these episodes a great way to deliver mystery and character development through smart use of its time loops. With that in mind, here are 10 TV shows that did Groundhog Day episodes. Xena: Warrior Princess - "Been There, Done That" 
In the episode 3.11 Mystery Spot Sam relives a Groundhog Day-like universe in which Dean dies every day under strange and inevitable circumstances. The color filter that usually darkens the picture and makes every Supernatural episode a bit grainier and bleak looking isn't used for most of the episode, but it comes back just when Zachariah  
A few that haven't been on the show surprisingly, Pink Floyd - Wish You We're Here. It has a line "Did you trade a walk on part in the war for a lead role in the cage" just a lot of the song lyrically would fit so well. 
Really interesting take on the Groundhog Day principle, which ties in well with the Supernatural story as you see a change in Sam as he becomes more ruthless, determined and detached from others in trying to change Dean's fate.

I wish this episode had gotten a couple more rewrites, but I'm a sucker for the Groundhog Day trope and I have a big soft spot for this one. For me one of the biggest things going for it is the tonal shift of going from watching Groundhog Day to watching Taxi Driver (the military bed-making and recreating John's trunk are bad enough, Sam at a  </p>
