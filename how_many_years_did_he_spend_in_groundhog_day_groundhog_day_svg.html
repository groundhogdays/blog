        <p>Sadly, the Heeb interview is no longer online, but Wolf Gnards did include a snippet of that interview in a second blog post: “I think the 10-year estimate is too short. It takes at least 10 years to get good at anything, and allotting for the down time and misguided years he spent, it had to be more like 30 or 40 years 
According to WhatCulture.com — which meticulously took into account the 38 days actually shown during Groundhog Day; the 414 days that were mentioned; the 11,931 days Phil spent learning things like ice sculpting, French poetry, and playing the piano; and the days he spent performing good deeds — Harold's second estimate was much closer.

"He said, 'Stephen, I'm a practicing Buddhist, and we believe that it takes 10,000 years to perfect a human soul, and the story of 'Groundhog Day' is the story of the perfection of the human soul. 
These included the 38 "days shown on screen", the 414 "days mentioned" (including the "six months, four to five hours a day" spent throwing playing cards into a hat), and the colossal 11,931 "days  
Phil relives the same day approximately 12,400 times in Groundhog Day, equating to almost 34 years. Groundhog Day director Harold Ramis initially believed Phil was trapped for 10 years, but later went back on his stance. 
The most false, when it comes to Groundhog Day, is the widely-reported notion that an early version of Rubin's script had Phil explicitly saying to Rita that he had been "waiting for you every day  
In the DVD commentary, Ramis estimated a real-time duration of 10 years. Later, Ramis told a reporter, "I think the 10-year estimate is too short. It takes at least 10 years to get good at anything, and allotting for the down time and misguided years he spent, it had to be more like 30 or 40 years." 
Therefore, he said, in a spiritual sense, the entire arc of Groundhog Day spans 10,000 years.[18]  and allotting for the down time and misguided years he spent, it  
Just how many days does Phil Connors spend trapped in the perpetual loop of Groundhog Day?  and alloting for the down time and misguided years he spent, it had to be more like 30 or 40 years. 
I assume he must have spent several years. We get a first clue when he mentions learning card throwing in 6 months. Judging by his piano skill at the end, he probably had to spend a few years, unless he's a prodigy like we've never seen. So, in your opinion, how much time do you think he spent in this endless day? 
I think Phil would've gone utterly insane in 10,000 years living the same day. Plus I think he would've had a much bigger reaction when it finally ended because it would be a massive shock to suddenly move to the next day after 10,000 years. You wouldn't even remember how things were prior to "groundhog day". 
Then, how many years was Phil stuck in Groundhog Day? Ramis once said Phil was trapped in Groundhog Day for 10 years, even though the original plan was to have him trapped for 10,000 years. According to the website Wolf Gnards, which ran the numbers, Phil was actually trapped for eight years, eight months and 16 days. 
On the DVD, Harold Ramis states that the original idea was for him to live February 2nd for about 10,000 years. Later he says that Phil probably lived the same day for about 10 years. According to the website Wolf Gnards, Bill Murray spends 8 years, 8 months and 16 days trapped in Groundhog Day. 
Earlier this year on the traditional Pennsylvania holiday of Groundhog Day (February 2), Sky aired the film 13 times in a row for 24 hours. More about Groundhog Day Pennsylvania Bill Murray 
We see him relive Groundhog Day 38 times in the movie while another 414 days were mentioned in the film. Whatculture.com then used the theory that it takes 10,000 hours to master any one subject which brings his total to at least 12,395 days, assuming he mastered the piano, French poetry, and ice sculpting at different times. </p>
