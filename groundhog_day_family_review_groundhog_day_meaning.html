Funny theme but there are some inappropriate scenes for little children. At one point, he sits next to a pretty lady at a cafe and asks her name and where she went to school and the next day, (or the same day but the next day for him) he pretends to recognise her and says a few pickup lines and then the scene cuts and they’re having a seriously steamy making out session which even makes

Flesh Wound Farce is back, and just in time for the holiday we discuss and review the Harold Raimis classic comedy GROUNDHOG DAY starring Bill Murray.SUPPORT 
Don't get me wrong - I was expecting a complete rip-off of Groundhog Day with Amy Smart as the protagonist, reliving Christmas Eve &amp; all the complications of rekindling an ex-love, a blind date as well as other friendships along the way.

PITTSBURGH, Pennsylvania (KDKA) — This Sunday, Feb. 2, all eyes will turn to Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, as the world’s most famous groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, will  
In Groundhog Day, time seems literally endless. But for us, on this Earth, time is a finite thing—and often, the time given to us feels oh so short. Because of Groundhog Day’s time loop, Phil Connors has the opportunity to live the day again and again—correcting mistakes, perfecting approaches, honing himself into, well, a decent human
