The 1993 Harold Ramis comedy "Groundhog Day" may not have spawned the hero-caught-in-a-time-loop genre, but it certainly prodded it to life.To this day, the film carries a 97% rating from critics

The morning kicks off with Phil listening to a weather report on the radio, which predicts a blizzard in Punxsutawney. Phil reluctantly dresses for Groundhog Day and feels disdain for the festival and its concept. 
Groundhog Day is observed on February 2, according to the local legend, a day when the groundhog comes out of hibernation, and the locals determine the season change following this event. “ [I]f the groundhog wakes and sees his shadow, we’ve got six more weeks of winter to look forward to,” Connors explains.

The Bodyguard and Groundhog Day are not 80s movies. They came out in the early 90s, and besides that feel really of the decade to me (at least the first part of it). But I take your point that so many movies from the 80s and 90s have been adapted, although I quite liked Groundhog Day personally. Ghost is another example.

Bill Murray could have woken up on Groundhog Day in Mineral Point, Wisconsin, not Woodstock.

The loop continued on for longer than reality existed at the point of its start, until he forgot anything even outside of it and in the end just sat around apathetically, waiting for his life to end. But it doesn't. Ever. </p>
