        <p>What is Groundhog Day? People flock to Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, on Feb. 2 every year to be a part of the celebrations revolving around Punxsutawney Phil's winter forecast. 
Of course, this prediction only refers to winter weather — and not the actual season — as the Spring Equinox consistently falls within the same two-day span each year. Annually, Groundhog Day  
The first official Groundhog Day took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The event took up permanent residence at Gobbler’s Knob the following year. 
Will the Groundhog See His Shadow in 2025? According to our weather predictions, February 2, 2025, will bring snow showers and cold weather. We think that when Punxsutawney Phil—that Seer of Seers, Sage of Sages, Weather Prognosticator Extraordinary— emerges from his burrow (with a little help from his handlers) to make his much-anticipated forecast, he will NOT see his shadow, which  
Last year, he didn't see his shadow, indicating an early spring. He has seen his shadow the most, as he has predicted a longer winter 107 (77%) times before the 2024 prediction. Here's are all of  
The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records.

Groundhog Day has been celebrated in the United States since at least February 2, 1886. Starting in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, with its now-famous groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, the tradition spread throughout America. 
The Farmers' Almanac and Punxsutawney Phil didn't necessarily agree last year. According to The Punxsutawney Groundhog Club , Phil did not see his shadow in 2024, which called for an early spring. 
Why is Groundhog Day celebrated on Feb. 2? The origins of Groundhog Day date back to German settlers in the 1800s and the celebration of the Christian festival of Candlemas, held on Feb. 2. 
Groundhog Day, in the United States and Canada, day (February 2) on which the emergence of the groundhog from its burrow is said to foretell the weather for the following six weeks. The beginning of February, which falls roughly halfway between the winter solstice and the spring equinox , has long been a significant time of the year in many  
However, last year did not fall in line with the norm. Phil has now seen his shadow 107 times, with no shadow 21 times (10 years of data are missing),  Here's when Groundhog Day began:  
But over the last 10 years, the groundhog has been correct only two other times: 2020 and 2015, resulting in an accuracy rate of 30%. In fairness to Phil, climatology isn't for the faint of heart. 
Here's what the weather forecast shows for Punxsutawney Phil's prediction for Groundhog Day on Sunday morning.  last year's declaration of an early spring was a pretty accurate prediction. 
Of course, this prediction only refers to winter weather — and not the actual season — as the Spring Equinox consistently falls within the same two-day span each year. Annually, Groundhog Day
