Groundhog Day will be performed at the Old Vic from 20 May to 12 August, with a press performance on 8 June. The show has received critical acclaim during its initial run, being described by Sarah Crompton as “a cast-iron triumph, both joyful and profound, incredibly funny and seriously moving.”

Karl won an Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Musical, and earned a Tony Award nomination for Best Actor. The first “Groundhog Day” celebration of its kind took place at Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, on 2 Feb. 1887.
