The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The annual ritual has roots in pre-Christian traditions and was brought to the U.S. by

Groundhog Day, in the United States and Canada, day (February 2) on which the emergence of the groundhog from its burrow is said to foretell the weather for the following six weeks. The beginning of February, which falls roughly halfway between the winter solstice and the spring equinox , has long been a significant time of the year in many  
On February 2, 1887, Groundhog Day, featuring a rodent meteorologist, is celebrated for the first time at Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania.According to tradition, if a groundhog

Crowds as large as 30,000 have turned out to Punxsutawney for multi-day Groundhog Day festivities, which the state calls a significant tourism boost for the town of fewer than 6,000 people. The ceremony itself — which returned to the stage in 2022 after a COVID-19 hiatus — features dancers, music, speeches and visitors from around the world. 
The Enduring Appeal of Groundhog Day. Despite its roots in superstition and folklore, Groundhog Day has endured as a beloved tradition for over 130 years. Its popularity speaks to the human need for levity, hope, and communal celebration, especially during the long, dark days of winter. 
An unusual, yet beloved holiday February 2nd is Groundhog Day, the day when a groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil predicts whether or not we will have six more weeks of winter. If he sees his shadow, more cold is on the way; if not, warmer weather is coming. While this holiday may seem like a silly tradition, it has a surprisingly deep history. Ancient Traditions 
Since 1887, Groundhog Day has been an American celebration focused on a groundhog predicting the weather. Each year, thousands gather in Pennsylvania to experience the festivities. 
Ramis once said Phil was trapped in Groundhog Day for 10 years, even though the original plan was to have him trapped for 10,000 years. According to the website Wolf Gnards, which ran the numbers, Phil was actually trapped for eight years, eight months and 16 days. 
But over the last 10 years, the groundhog has been correct only two other times: 2020 and 2015, resulting in an accuracy rate of 30%. In fairness to Phil, climatology isn't for the faint of heart. 
It has been serialized in Shogakukan's Weekly Shōnen Sunday since January 19, 1994, and has been collected into 105 tankōbon volumes as of January, 2024. The anime first aired on January 8, 1996 and is one of the longest continuing anime series with 1112 episodes as of January, 2024.

Since the 1800s, Groundhog Day has been observed on Feb. 2. The longstanding tradition calls for the fur-bearing weather forecaster to tell us if spring is coming. According to the lore, if the groundhogs — known as woodchucks in Michigan — emerge from their burrows and: 
According to Groundhog Club members, there has only been one Phil and he has been predicting since 1887, making him 135 years old. His longevity is credited to drinking “the elixir of life,” a  
"According to the website Wolf Gnards, Bill Murray spends 8 years, 8 months and 16 days trapped in Groundhog Day. The website Obsessed With Film claims he was trapped 12,403 days, just under 34 years, in order to account for becoming a master piano player, ice sculptor, etc." 
How can I celebrate 2025 Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney? While there are a handful of local celebrations of the holiday, the most well-known Groundhog Day event takes place on Feb. 2 in Punxsutawney. The Groundhog Day celebration is organized by the “ Inner Circle ” of the town’s “Groundhog Club.” These tuxedoed men in top hats conduct  
How often is Punxsutawney Phil right? Well, while the groundhog predictions provide a lot of fun, but they are rarely right. Punxsutawney Phil has been right 39% of the time since the tradition  
This brings us back to the original question: How long was Bill Murray trapped in Groundhog Day?. Originally, the film's director, Harold Ramis, stated that he thought Bill's character was trapped in Punxsutawney for about 10 years. </p>
