        <h2><strong>what happens at the end of groundhog day groundhog day movie clip i got you babe</strong></h2>
        <p>The 1993 Harold Ramis comedy "Groundhog Day" may not have spawned the hero-caught-in-a-time-loop genre, but it certainly prodded it to life.To this day, the film carries a 97% rating from critics  
At the end of Groundhog Day, Phil Connors learns to use the time he has to enhance his life and use his abilities to help others, making him a popular figure in Punxsutawney, finally winning the heart of Rita, and breaking the endless repeating loop of Groundhog Day. 
Groundhog Day, directed by Harold Ramis and released in 1993, has become a timeless classic that continues to captivate audiences to this day. The movie follows the story of Phil Connors, played by Bill Murray, a cynical weatherman who finds himself trapped in a time loop, reliving the same day over and over again. 
Every day he befriends an elderly dying homeless man, catches a boy falling from a tree, performs a lifesaving Heimlich Maneuver, encourages a soon-to-be-married couple having cold feet, etc. During his busy day, he learns to play the piano and ice sculpt, and falls in love with Rita. One day, Rita, dazzled by the change in Phil, "buys" him for  
Furthermore, if Phil had wanted to learn a new skill, make a pile of money by playing the day trading market, or allow himself more time to enjoy his vacation, he merely has to act selfishly for a day and the Universe permits the day to be repeated. His friends &amp; loved ones won't remember what a jerk he was for that one day. :) – 
They arrive in town a day before the festival, and Phil’s Groundhog Day starts early at 6 am. The morning kicks off with Phil listening to a weather report on the radio, which predicts a blizzard in Punxsutawney. Phil reluctantly dresses for Groundhog Day and feels disdain for the festival and its concept. 
Groundhog Day is observed on February 2, according to the local legend, a day when the groundhog comes out of hibernation, and the locals determine the season change following this event. “ [I]f the groundhog wakes and sees his shadow, we’ve got six more weeks of winter to look forward to,” Connors explains. 
Ramis’ instincts were to make Groundhog Day more accessible, and the ending he gave the movie is perfect. Rubin’s twist is like the day where Phil convinces Rita that he is repeating February  
Phil's character arc and transformation, as well as gaining Rita's approval, are what ultimately bring an end to the time loop. At the end of Groundhog Day, Phil Connors learns to use the time he has to enhance his life and use his abilities to help others, making him a popular figure in Punxsutawney, finally winning the heart of Rita, and  
To me, every day of this pandemic has felt likeGroundhog Day. I get up, I write some articles, I work on my script, I wander my neighborhood, and I go to bed doing the same thing again and again and again. Still, it's hard to think about a movie as culturally significant as Groundhog Day. It created a whole genre of comedy where people relive  
The Legacy of Groundhog Day. Groundhog Day’s enduring popularity stems from its combination of folklore, community spirit, and humor. It offers a moment of levity in the depths of winter and connects people to nature and the changing seasons. Bill Murray Groundhog Day. The holiday gained additional cultural significance with the 1993 film  
By the end of Happy Death Day, you may be expecting closure, but you'll be hard-pressed to find any. In fact, by the time the credits roll in this Groundhog Dog-esque slasher, it won't be closure you're getting, but cupcakes. (Yes, cupcakes.) 
By the end of the film, Phil is a virtuoso on the piano and he regales the Groundhog Day dinner guests with his brilliant piano skills. While everyone is clapping, the piano teacher turns to Rita and proudly declares "He's my student!" If the day restarts, how does the piano teacher even know Phil? It's possible that he showed up for a lesson  
In groundhog day, I don't think we ever have a reason to believe anyone but Phil is aware of the resets. Everything but Phil's consciousness is restored to exactly how they were when the alarm woke Phil the first time. 
If money reward for the day is little get busted by the cops and the next day rewards are much better. Get good at grip because by the end of the week 2 and further the cars are actually fast enough that grip becomes a must and actually is more rewarding. I had my garage upgraded by the end of week 3 to the fullest. 
PHIL: It was the end of a very long day." The end of Groundhog Day shows us that Phil Connors has finally succeeded in escaping from the seemingly endless repetition of February 2nd. We realize that his escape has been triggered by his transformation into a good person and by the fact that he is finally worthy of Rita's love. 
2. LOCK IN (End of Act One) The next morning Phil is woken by the clock radio. He feels something is wrong (18:21): The radio announcers are repeating what they had said yesterday like a recorder. And everybody stands in the exact same spot they were in the day before, talking about Groundhog Day again. Phil asks them what day it is. 
Groundhog Day, the 1993 film Ramis directed and co-wrote with Danny Rubin, became an underground Buddhist classic, despite the fact that the words “Buddhist” or “Buddha” never appear in the script, or that neither Ramis nor Rubin intended it to be Buddhist or Christian or Jewish or any of the other denominations that say it speaks to  
If we're being honest, it even defies common sense. The legend is simple: The groundhog's shadow on Feb. 2 predicts the weather for the next six weeks, until the start of spring. 
The movie’s twist comes on February 2. Phil wakes up at 6:00 a.m. He goes through his day and at the end of it, turns in for the night. He wakes up in the morning and, to his disbelief, the day  </p>
