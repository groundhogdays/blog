A scene from Groundhog Day featuring the song "I Got You Babe" by Sonny and Cher. 
Homage to the movie Groundhog Day from 1993!Eine Hommage an den Film "Und täglich grüßt das Murmeltier" von 1993!Movie info:  
The soundtrack for Groundhog Day (1993) is one of the movie's most memorable elements. Featuring iconic tracks like Sonny &amp; Cher's “I Got You Babe” and Delbert McClinton's “Weatherman". "Pennsylvania Polka" made by Frankie Yankovic, helps to give the movie a fast pace and joyful melody that creates an uplifting atmosphere. 
In the 1993 film Groundhog Day starring Bill Murray, Murray's character is awakened to this song every morning at precisely 6:00 a.m. on the alarm clock in his hotel room. The movie grew a cult of fans that watched it every February 2, giving it a foothold in the popular culture. 
It’s cold out there every day.” During the course of morning repeats (literally, with clearly over a thousand ‘days’ to endure), it all starts at 6am, when the alarm clock begins its dreaded, inevitable lyrics. Phil throws, smashes, drowns, and abuses the clock, but each day it keeps sucking Phil into another February 2nd. 
Groundhog Day (1993) - The clock seen in the movie is actually a prop clock that was designed to flip back and forth between 5:59 and 6:00. In addition the alarm goes off and plays the song exactly when the clock flips to 6:00. With a real flip clock the alarm can go off randomly around the time the alarm has been set to activate. 
Richard Henzel (born June 15, 1949) is a Chicago-based stage, film, TV, and voice-over actor. He is best known as one of the two DJ voices on the clock radio in the movie Groundhog Day. What song is playing in Groundhog Day? I Got You Babe Groundhog Day is anchored by uplifting songs that make a complex foundation for a quirky film. 
Radio/Alarm Clock. The song that plays as the alarm informing Phil it is time to get up on the clock/radio is by Sonny and Cher and the title “I Got You, Babe” seem to mock Phil with the taunt that he is trapped forever by the fates. A clock also figures prominently in the movie’s poster and media art. 
The day resets when the alarm goes off. Lifting this directly from an article I read on the movie's symbolism: Radio/Alarm Clock. The song that plays as the alarm informing Phil it is time to get up on the clock/radio is by Sonny and Cher and the title “I Got You, Babe” seem to mock Phil with the taunt that he is trapped forever by the fates. 
Step 3: Set the Alarm. Open the Alarm app on your phone. Edit an existing alarm or create a new one. Click on "Sound," then "Pick a Song," and then search for "Groundhog Day." If everything worked, you'll be able to select the file you downloaded. 
The most likely crossword and word puzzle answers for the clue of What Song Does Bill Murrays Alarm Clock Play Every Morning In The Movie Groundhog Day 
The Groundhog Day Alarm Clock consists of a Panasonic RC-6025 flip clock modified to play the audio from the movie Groundhog Day when the alarm goes off. The reason I have created this device is because Groundhog Day (both the day and film) held special meaning for me because I first met my ex-partner-in-crime on February 2nd. 
I finally made a video on how to perform this modification. 6/6/2016: Sorry about the poor quality of this mov

In the movie, the song "I Got You Babe" by Sonny &amp; Cher plays repeatedly on the alarm clock as a comedic device to show the repetitive and monotonous nature of the main character's daily routine. The song's upbeat and catchy melody contrasts with the character's frustration, creating a humorous and memorable moment in the film.
