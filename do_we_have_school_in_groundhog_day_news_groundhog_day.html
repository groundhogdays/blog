        <p>In the United States, whether or not schools have classes on Groundhog Day, also known as February 2nd, largely depends on the school district and the state.

Have students work in groups to come up with one hundred ways to represent the number “100”. Some examples are: 50+50; 102-2  
In Nova Scotia, Groundhog Day is called Daks Day. This comes from the word “dachs” which is German for badger. While Germans don’t celebrate Groundhog Day, they do celebrate a holiday they call Dachstag on February 2. The history of Groundhog Day goes back hundreds of years to an old European tradition that involved watching for animals  
Your young learners may not know what a groundhog is, let alone why we have a day to celebrate it each year. They might not understand why thousands of people gather in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, on a cold morning every February to watch a man in a tuxedo hold a groundhog—while many more watch the ceremony live on television. 
The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records.

The Origins of Groundhog Day.
