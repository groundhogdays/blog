Bill Murray starred in Groundhog Day in 1993Columbia Pictures Sign up to our new free Indy100 weekly newsletter According to Whatculture.com , Bill was stuck in the loop for 33 years and 350 days. 
According to WhatCulture.com — which meticulously took into account the 38 days actually shown during Groundhog Day; the 414 days that were mentioned; the 11,931 days Phil spent learning things like ice sculpting, French poetry, and playing the piano; and the days he spent performing good deeds — Harold's second estimate was much closer. 
The web page explores the question of how many days Bill Murray's character spent reliving the same day in the 1993 comedy film. It cites different sources and estimates that it was around 33 years, 350 days, based on his skills and events in the movie. 
In honor of Groundhog Day last week — when Punxsutawney Phil predicted an early spring (so we got that going for us [and, yes, I am mixing my Bill Murray movie references]) — Gallagher pinpointed the exact number of Groundhog Days Murray's Phil Connors endures in “Groundhog Day:” 12,403 days. 
Almost since the film’s release (which happened 10 days after Groundhog Day), it has obsessed fans and dogged the film’s cast and crew. Groundhog Day follows Bill Murray’s character, Phil  
Bill Murray's role as Phil Connors in 1993's Groundhog Day is one for the ages, especially considering he hated his experience behind-the-scenes just as much as his character did onscreen! 
2 February is Groundhog Day – when, according to Punxsutawney folklore – a groundhog called Punxsutawney Phil predicts the arrival of spring.  These included the 38 "days shown on screen  
Phil relives the same day approximately 12,400 times in Groundhog Day, equating to almost 34 years. Groundhog Day director Harold Ramis initially believed Phil was trapped for 10 years, but later went back on his stance. 
For how many days was he trapped in Groundhog Day? In the iconic film "Groundhog Day," Bill Murray's character finds himself trapped in a time loop, reliving the same day over and over again. According to Whatculture.com, this peculiar predicament lasted an astonishing 33 years and 350 days, resulting in a staggering total of 12,395 repetitions

A lifetime."[48] In 2014, the website WhatCulture combined various time duration assumptions and estimated that Phil spent a total of 12,395 days—just under 34 years—reliving Groundhog Day.[49][50] 
In one early version of the script it stated that phil spent 10000 days (27 years) repeating the same day. Many people contemplate this though and argue that he only spent around 10 years. Either way, its still a LONG time. 
We see him relive Groundhog Day 38 times in the movie while another 414 days were mentioned in the film. Whatculture.com then used the theory that it takes 10,000 hours to master any one subject which brings his total to at least 12,395 days, assuming he mastered the piano, French poetry, and ice sculpting at different times.
