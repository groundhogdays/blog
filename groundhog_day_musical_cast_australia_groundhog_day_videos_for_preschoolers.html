Critically acclaimed on both the West End and Broadway, Groundhog Day revels in one man's journey of self-discovery, day after day. Inspired by the hilarious film starring Bill Murray, Groundhog Day features a book by original co-screenwriter Danny Rubin, and music and lyrics by Tony Award nominee Tim Minchin (Matilda the Musical). 
The Bodyguard and Groundhog Day are not 80s movies. They came out in the early 90s, and besides that feel really of the decade to me (at least the first part of it). But I take your point that so many movies from the 80s and 90s have been adapted, although I quite liked Groundhog Day personally. Ghost is another example. 
The Old Vic in London has announced the full cast for its forthcoming revival of Groundhog Day The Musical.. Already announced is the star of the show Andy Karl, who is reprising his role as Phil Connors, which earned him an Olivier Award, Drama Desk Award and Outer Critics Circle Award.
