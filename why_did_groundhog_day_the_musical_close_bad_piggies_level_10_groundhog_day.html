        <h2><strong>why did groundhog day the musical close funny groundhog day photos</strong></h2>
        <p>Groundhog Day is a musical with music and lyrics by Tim Minchin and a book by Danny Rubin.  The Broadway production closed on 17 September 2017, after 176  
“Groundhog Day,” the ambitious stage adaptation of the popular 1993 film, will close on Sept. 17, the producers said Tuesday. The musical won some strong reviews, but was not universally  
“Groundhog Day,” the musical that won over critics and awards voters in the U.K. but never caught on in New York, has posted a Broadway closing notice for September after a run of five months. 
Despite its seven Tony nominations, the musical will close Sept. 17 after just 176 performances, The Post has learned. “ Groundhog Day ” is the second high-profile Broadway show to collapse in  
The Groundhog Day musical will soon be free of its time loop.. The stage adaptation of the beloved 1993 movie will close on Broadway, with its final performance set for Sept. 17 at the August  
The Bodyguard and Groundhog Day are not 80s movies. They came out in the early 90s, and besides that feel really of the decade to me (at least the first part of it). But I take your point that so many movies from the 80s and 90s have been adapted, although I quite liked Groundhog Day personally. Ghost is another example. 
That is because Groundhog Day the musical was playing eight shows a week back then. The show, based on the 1993 film of the same name, opened in April and closed just 6 months after. I’m writing about it today for a few reasons: It’s been one year since the show’s (untimely, if you ask me) demise. 
The musical, which closed on Broadway in September 2017, was slated to launch an 18-month tour this year.  National Tour News Planned Groundhog Day National Tour Canceled The musical, which  
Groundhog Day, the Broadway musical based on the 1993 romantic comedy starring Bill Murray, is ending its Broadway run September 17.  'Moana 2' This Close To $1B, 'Sonic 3' Racing To $400MWW  
Incredibly deft handling of tone, possibly the best I've seen in a musical. The balance between comedy and darkness has to be perfect. I do think the extent of its excellence doesn't come across from listening to the soundtrack, though, so maybe it's harder to get hyped about before seeing it. 
PUNXSUTAWNEY, PA - FEBRUARY 02: Groundhog Punxsutawney Phil climbs on the top hat of his handler after Phil did not see his shadow and predicting an early spring during the 127th Groundhog Day  
Groundhog Day I just saw Groundhog Day in London at the Old Vic last night andholy cow! I knew the story since it’s one of my favorite movies, knew one song, and knew I was dying to see Andy Karl in person. 
Furthermore, if Phil had wanted to learn a new skill, make a pile of money by playing the day trading market, or allow himself more time to enjoy his vacation, he merely has to act selfishly for a day and the Universe permits the day to be repeated. 
“There’s nothing more depressing than small town USA/And smaller doesn’t come smaller/Than Punxsutawney on Groundhog Day,” he sings, scornfully. But then a storm traps him and his producer Rita in the town overnight. When Phil wakes up, it is still Groundhog Day – and he is stuck in a time loop from which there seems no escape. 
Groundhog Day had its world premiere and enjoyed a critically acclaimed strictly limited 10 week season at The Old Vic Theatre, London, in the summer of 2016.. One of the most ambitious shows ever to have been staged at The Old Vic, previews began on the 15th July. 
As he navigates the repetitive day with humor and wit, Phil discovers that true change comes from within. Featuring catchy songs by Tim Minchin, the composer of MATILDA The Musical, sharp comedy, and a poignant message about redemption and love, this musical is a delightful celebration of second chances and self-discovery. 
Review by Suzanne Tate . Opening Night of Groundhog Day: The Musical was a highly anticipated event for me. I am a huge Tim Minchin fan and was excited to see how his satirical comedic wit and mind-blowing musical ability would transform the popular 1990s movie through the addition of his music and lyrics. 
Groundhog Day The Musical closed on Broadway on September 17, 2017. The show opened on April 17, 2017 and ran for 176 performances at the August Wilson Theatre. Groundhog Day The Musical is based on the 1993 Harold Ramis movie and has music and lyrics by British composer Tim Minchin. 
A beloved comedy classic is brought to the stage in Groundhog Day. Phil Connors, a sarcastic and self-centered TV weatherman from Pittsburgh, dreads his trip to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, every year, where he is forced to report on the annual Groundhog Day festivities. 
Some viewers may be surprised to learn that there was no major reason why Groundhog Day was the holiday chosen for the film's backdrop. In an online interview with [the film's] writer [Danny] Rubin, he explains: "There were many reasons that Groundhog Day was a good arbitrary choice. It was a good choice because it's in the dead of winter. </p>
