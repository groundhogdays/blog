        <p>Although crepes are eaten all year round in France, it’s tradition to eat crepes to celebrate “La Chandeleur” on February 2nd, precisely 40 days after Christmas, which happens to be Groundhog Day in certain parts of the world. 
Groundhog Day is one of the most superstitious holidays in the United States, though rest assured, Americans aren’t the only ones subject to mythical beliefs. Similarly, the French also celebrate a superstitious holiday on February 2nd, though it has little to do with marmots predicting the weather—and in classic French form, a lot more to  
Americans often spend February 2 huddled in the cold waiting for a groundhog to emerge from the earth, but the French have a much more fun way to spend the day. Every year on February 2, France  
In north America on 2 February, the point of mid-winter, they celebrate Groundhog Day. If you’ve ever seen the film you’ll know it’s the date on which a groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil emerges from his cosy hidey hole to predict the weather. According to legend, there’s only ever been one Phil – since 1886. 
Over time, Chandeleur also absorbed folkloric beliefs. One popular superstition holds that flipping a crêpe with one hand while holding a gold coin in the other ensures prosperity for the coming year. Another tradition says that if the weather on Chandeleur is clear, winter will last longer, echoing the Groundhog Day sentiment in North America. 
La Chandeleur and the US holiday Groundhog Day fall on the same date, February 2. The similarities don’t stop there: both are holidays with interesting roots that involve superstitions and forecasting the next year (Remember that some people even flip crepes on La Chandeleur to have good weather). 
As in the States with the groundhog, there’s a saying that if an otter sees its shadow on emerging from its burrow, it will go back in for 40 days. You can stay out, otters: not much chance of seeing the sun today You might also like: Épiphanie, the Day of the Three Kings, in France. Saint John’s Day Customs in France. French Solstice  
This week I propose we talk about the French “Chandeleur” (Candlemas), the French equivalent to “Groundhog day”, and about how it is celebrated in France. First of all, what is the French “Chandeleur”? The “Chandeleur” is originally a Christian commemoration that happens 40 days after Christmas, on February 2. 
Pour the juice of 2 oranges into a saucepan with the zest of 1 orange, 1/2 cup of butter (it's France after all), and 1/2 cup of sugar. Bring to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes until syrupy. Overlap pre-made crêpes folded into quarters into a flameproof dish such as a copper gratin pan. 
It’s crepe time in France! On February 2 nd Americans have Groundhog Day; the French have. la Chandeleur, or the fête des chandelles (candles) which translates as Candlemass in English, referring to the blessing of candles which traditionally took place on this day.

This week let's talk about the French “Chandeleur” (Candlemas), the French equivalent to “Groundhog day”, and about how it is celebrated in France.For recipe 
Groundhog Day, in the United States and Canada, day (February 2) on which the emergence of the groundhog from its burrow is said to foretell the weather for the following six weeks. In the United States the most popular event occurs in Pennsylvania and centers on a groundhog designated Punxsutawney Phil. 
But the prediction traditions can differ. Punxsutawny Phil predicts the end of winter in the US, but there are no such prognosticating critters in France. During Candlemas in France, the French simply pay attention to the weather. Rain on La Chandeleur is said to lead to 40 more days of rain, but a sunny day means winter is almost at an end.

In France, up to 5 inches of rain fell near the French border with Belgium. The BBC reported that up to six weeks’ worth of rain fell in just 24 hours. Meanwhile, around Paris in the Ile de France region, the heavy rains at the end of the month led to May rainfall totals of over 6.5 inches, which set a May rainfall record (records back to 1960).
