The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
The movieâ€˜s popularity had a significant impact on the real-life Groundhog Day celebration in Punxsutawney. Attendance at the event soared in the years following the filmâ€˜s release, with crowds growing from around 2,000 in the early 1990s to over 40,000 in recent years. The Enduring Appeal of Groundhog Day 
See how the groundhog became a symbol for predicting seasonal changes in America, rooted in German folklore with a badger â€” which in turn lead to Groundhog Day.

Updated February 2, 2024 at 8:19 AM ET. On Friday morning, thousands of early risers either tuned in or bundled up to watch Punxsutawney Phil emerge from a tree stump and predict the weather. 
Many years later, and weâ€™re still looking to Punxsutawney, and, of course, its top groundhog, Phil, to indicate whether or not we should bundle up or pack away the parkas. And The Farmerâ€™s Almanac says Phil is a crisp 130 years old, so he should be a pretty reliable source at this point. 
A groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil is central to the traditional Groundhog Day celebrations held each year on the 2 nd of February in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. Itâ€™s said that if Phil emerges from his burrow and is able to see his shadow, then there will be six more weeks of winter. If Phil cannot see his shadow, then spring will arrive early! 
All it takes is altering one area of your life to activate great changes in the future. You never know what might happen just by taking a different route to work. No more Groundhog DayI expect greatness! There shall be no more Groundhog Days feeling trapped and feeling as though you are living the same day over and over again.

Groundhog Day originated from an ancient European tradition called Candlemas Day, where clergy would bless candles and distribute them to ward off the darkness of winter. The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. 
"Every day is a repeat of the day before Every (television) session is identical," the man told doctors. "Wherever I go, the same people are on the side of the road, the same cars behind me with the same people in them the same person gets out of the cars wearing the same clothes, carrying the same bags, saying the same things nothing is new."
