        <h2><strong>what country celebrates groundhog day groundhog day funny clip</strong></h2>
        <p>The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
Groundhog Day, in the United States and Canada, day (February 2) on which the emergence of the groundhog from its burrow is said to foretell the weather for the following six weeks. In the United States the most popular event occurs in Pennsylvania and centers on a groundhog designated Punxsutawney Phil. 
Groundhog Day is a widely celebrated tradition in North America, particularly in the United States and Canada. Every year on February 2nd, people eagerly await the emergence of a groundhog from its burrow to predict the arrival of spring. However, this unique holiday is not limited to just these two countries. 
The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The annual ritual has roots in pre-Christian traditions and was brought to the U.S. by  
In Canada, Groundhog Day is also celebrated on February 2nd, and there are various noteworthy Groundhog Day festivities throughout the country. One of the most prominent Groundhog Day celebrations in Canada occurs in Wiarton, Ontario. 
The Groundhog Day ceremony in Punxsutawney is conducted in Pennsylvania Dutch, a dialect of German. Groundhog Day is also celebrated in other countries, such as Germany, where it is known as "Siebenschläfertag" or "Seven Sleepers Day." In Alaska, instead of a groundhog, they use a marmot to predict the weather on February 2nd.

Over time, the Groundhog Day tradition integrated with local customs, creating a unique celebration that persisted through the years. The American tradition has a big focus on Punxsutawney Phil. The event is organized by the “Groundhog Club,” who communicate with Phil in a language known as “Groundhogese” to interpret his prediction  
The Birth of Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney. The first recorded Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2nd, 1886, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The event was organized by local newspaper editor Clymer Freas and a group of businessmen and groundhog hunters known as the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club. 
The Brief. Woodstock, Illinois, became the filming location for "Groundhog Day" (1993), and the town now celebrates the movie with an annual festival that attracts visitors from around the world. 
While Punxsutawney Phil remains the star of the nation’s most famous Groundhog Day celebration, Pennsylvania Dutch Country and other parts of the state offer equally charming events to mark the day. 
Whether Punxsutawney Phil predicts six more weeks of winter or early spring, there’s no better way to celebrate than with Groundhog Day crafts. These hands-on activities are an excellent way to bring the fun of the holiday to life while encouraging kids to learn, play, and create.
