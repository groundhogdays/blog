        <p>The Very First Groundhog Day The first Groundhog Day was celebrated on February 2nd, 1887, at Gobbler's Knob.

Groundhog Day falls on the second day of the second month of the year. Reader's Digest writes that the United States adopted the holiday in 1887, but its roots go back way farther in time. The tradition is partly inherited from the Pagan celebration of the midpoint between the shortest day of the year, winter solstice, and the spring equinox  
See how the groundhog became a symbol for predicting seasonal changes in America, rooted in German folklore with a badger — which in turn lead to Groundhog Day. 
5 biggest Groundhog Day myths and misconceptions, from the history to the predictions. Published: ; Jan. 30, 2016, 12:15 p.m. 
German settlers arriving in the U.S. quickly found out there were no badgers in Pennsylvania, so they went with the groundhog instead. The real reason the groundhog comes out on February 2 has

One hundred and nineteen years later, Groundhog Day still garners headlines all across the country. According to the top-hatted members of the local Groundhog Club, Punxsutawney’s Phil (in all his subsequent incarnations— groundhogs live an average of only 5 years) is batting a thousand in the weather-prediction department, though  
The first recorded mention of Groundhog Day in America dates back to 1841 when it appeared in a diary entry by James Morris. However, it wasn’t until February 2nd, 1887 when a newspaper editor named Clymer H. Freas from Punxsutawney declared Punxsutawney Phil as the official weather-forecasting groundhog.

Popular belief claims that bad weather and cloudy skies on February 2 mean an early and prosperous summer. If the sun shines through the greater part of Candlemas Day, there will be forty more days of snow. This superstition is familiar to all in our famous story of the ground hog looking for his shadow on Candlemas Day.” 
It's possible that he died in the blizzard on the first day of the loop, but it might have also been an earthly miracle - he'll never really know.

Groundhog Day is Fun! But It Is Not True Prophecy. Acknowledge the lighthearted fun of Groundhog Day and its role in Pennsylvania tradition. Emphasize that true prophecy comes from God, not from prognosticators, prestidigitators, or any other worldly sources.
