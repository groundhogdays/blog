        <p>Groundhog Day is Sunday, and now is a good time to familiarize yourself before you check out the annual weather forecasting festivals in New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. Here's what you need  
Punxsutawney Phil will make his annual prediction Sunday morning. The forecast calls for cloudy skies, which favors no shadow sighting and an early start to spring, according to legend. But  
Punxsutawney Phil is the best-known groundhog who has been making predictions since 1886, according to Punxsutawney Groundhog Club. The Groundhog Day tradition as we know it dates to 1887. 
Here is what you need to know about Groundhog Day: the day dedicated to a weather-predicting rodent.  In 2024, Phil predicted we would see an early spring, and he was technically correct! 
Of course, this prediction only refers to winter weather — and not the actual season — as the Spring Equinox consistently falls within the same two-day span each year. Annually, Groundhog Day  
A Middlebury College team found that Phil's long-term analysis of temperature high/low predictions were 70% accurate, although when the groundhog predicted early spring it was usually wrong. [119] Canadian meteorologist Cindy Day has estimated that Nova Scotia's " Shubenacadie Sam " has an accuracy rate of about 45%, compared to 25% for Wiarton  
Groundhog Day has a rich history based on a deeper meaning; it speaks to the triumph of spring over winter—and birth over death. Again, note the appearance of light over dark with the appearance of candles and dawn—and, of course, the spiritual light of a holier presence. 
Punxsutawney Phil rises without a shadow, forecasting early spring For Groundhog Day in 2024, Punxsutawney Phil did not see his shadow, elating a massive crowd at Gobbler's Knob. 
Groundhog Day Inner Circle Vice President Dan McGinley announces the weather prognostication as groundhog handler AJ Dereume holds Punxsutawney Phil after he did not see his shadow predicting an early Spring during the 138th annual Groundhog Day festivities on Friday February 2, 2024 in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. (Jeff Swensen) 
Bottom line: It was 39 degrees F (3.8 C) this morning in Punxsutawney, PA, when Phil predicted an early spring. Happy Groundhog Day! 101 X 5.4k Facebook 14 Pinterest 51 Buffer Share. 5.6k. 
LIVE Groundhog Day 2024: Punxsutawney Phil, Staten Island Chuck predict an early spring Punxsutawney Phil is forecasting an early spring from the largest and best known Groundhog Day celebration in the United States at Gobbler’s Knob in western Pennsylvania. 
In 2021, Groundhog Day was on Tuesday, February 2nd. Most groundhogs (63%) predicted an early spring. 
In 2022, Groundhog Day was on Wednesday, February 2nd. Most groundhogs (57%) predicted an early spring. 
Vice President Dan McGinley read the decision, written in verse and filled with quips about the groundhog’s envy for humans’ opposable thumbs and hopes to garner some Punxsutawney Phil write-in votes in 2024, from the chosen scroll and announced, “Glad tidings on this Groundhog Day, an early spring is on the way!” 
Here is what you need to know about Groundhog Day: the day dedicated to a weather-predicting rodent.  In 2024, Phil predicted we would see an early spring, and he was technically correct! 
"Glad tidings on this Groundhog Day, an early spring is on the way!" Tradition says that North America will get six more weeks of winter if Phil sees his shadow and an early spring if he does not.

Punxsutawney Phil emerged from his burrow and did not see his shadow, predicting an early spring. Don’t get too excited, though – he’s usually wrong. 
On Friday, a.k.a. Groundhog Day, people from around the country waited to see what Punxsutawney Phil would see when he emerged from his hole — and he didn't see his shadow, predicting spring  </p>
