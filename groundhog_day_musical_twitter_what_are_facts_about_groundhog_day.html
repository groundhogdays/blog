Terrific interview with @timminchin in @guardian; previews begin two weeks today for the return of GROUNDHOG DAY to @oldvictheatre, his musical masterpiece that I saw ten times during its original London and Broadway runs! 29 Apr 2023 09:22:03 
Groundhog Day was the first musical theatre sheet music book I bought - I figured "If I can play this, I can play anything". I can still only fumble my way through a couple of the songs (Minchin is a musical genius), but I do play through it regularly. 
Incredibly deft handling of tone, possibly the best I've seen in a musical. The balance between comedy and darkness has to be perfect. I do think the extent of its excellence doesn't come across from listening to the soundtrack, though, so maybe it's harder to get hyped about before seeing it. 
The musical is based on the 1993 film Groundhog Day. [3] The film itself starred Bill Murray as Phil Connors and Andie MacDowell as Rita Hanson and was produced on a budget of $14.6 million, earning over $70 million in domestic box office receipts. [4] 
The Bodyguard and Groundhog Day are not 80s movies. They came out in the early 90s, and besides that feel really of the decade to me (at least the first part of it). But I take your point that so many movies from the 80s and 90s have been adapted, although I quite liked Groundhog Day personally. Ghost is another example.

Inspired by the hilarious film starring Bill Murray, Groundhog Day features a book by original co-screenwriter Danny Rubin, and music and lyrics by Tony Award nominee Tim Minchin (Matilda the Musical).
