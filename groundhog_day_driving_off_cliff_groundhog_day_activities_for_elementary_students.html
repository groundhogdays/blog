The chase ends with Phil driving off a cliff in an attempt to kill himself, yet he still wakes up the next day in a bed and breakfast with Sonny and Cher playing on the radio. Phil spends the next few days trying different suicide methods including bathing with a toaster, getting hit by oncoming traffic, and jumping off a building.
