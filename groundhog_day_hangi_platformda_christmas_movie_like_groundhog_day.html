        <h2><strong>groundhog day hangi platformda what is groundhog day for a black man on</strong></h2>
        <p>The observance of Groundhog Day in the United States first occurred in German communities in Pennsylvania, according to known records. The earliest mention of Groundhog Day is an entry on February 2, 1840, in the diary of James L. Morris of Morgantown, in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, according to the book on the subject by Don Yoder. This was a  
Seeing the groundhog in person can be a memorable experience. Take a hike. Embrace the day by going on a nature walk to look for signs of spring. You might not find a groundhog, but it's a great way to enjoy the outdoors and connect with nature. Groundhog Day has come a long way from an ancient tradition to an unusual cultural phenomenon. 
Groundhog Day originated from an ancient European tradition called Candlemas Day, where clergy would bless candles and distribute them to ward off the darkness of winter. The first official Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2, 1887, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. 
It was 1961 before the groundhog was dubbed “Punxsutawney Phil” and the tradition began to attract a wider audience of about 2,000 people. But the biggest change came following the 1993 Groundhog Day movie starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell (German title: Und täglich grüßt das Murmeltier). The crowds soon swelled to 10,000. 
The Groundhog Day tradition came to North America from German settlers in Pennsylvania. The celebration dates back to Candlemas Day , a Christian holiday observed on February 2nd. 
In 1886, Groundhog Day was acknowledged for the first time in Punxsutawney by a local newspaper, Weathers Wags, according to the club. In 1887, the first official pilgrimage to see Phil on Gobbler  
life.The spectacle of Groundhog Day is the groundhog’s interaction with its shadow. According to legend, if the groundhog sees its shadow and retreats to its burrow, then there will be six more weeks of winter. On the other hand, if the day is cloudy and the groundhog doesn’t see its shadow, then an early spring is predicted. 
An unusual, yet beloved holiday February 2nd is Groundhog Day, the day when a groundhog named Punxsutawney Phil predicts whether or not we will have six more weeks of winter. If he sees his shadow, more cold is on the way; if not, warmer weather is coming. While this holiday may seem like a silly tradition, it has a surprisingly deep history. Ancient Traditions 
The Birth of Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney. The first recorded Groundhog Day celebration took place on February 2nd, 1886, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. The event was organized by local newspaper editor Clymer Freas and a group of businessmen and groundhog hunters known as the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club. 
America has been looking to Punxsutawney Phil for over 130 years to indicate whether or not we'll have a short or long winter. But Groundhog Day goes back way further than that. Here's the complete history of the holiday, as well as when it is and how Punxsutawney Phil came to be. 
Groundhog Day is a holiday celebrated in the United States and Canada on February 2, each year. In weather lore, if a groundhog emerges from its burrow on this day and fails to see its shadow because the weather is cloudy, winter will soon end.

Bir hava durumu spikeri olan Phil Connors, yapımcısı ve sevimli kameramanı ile birlikte Pennsylvania'daki Punxsutawney kasabasına geleneksel Groundhog Day şenliklerini görüntülemek için gönderilir.

Groundhog Day has arrived once again, and while tradition dictates we let a rodent predict future weather patterns, there's more to do than just watch Punxsutawney Phil emerge from a burrow.
