        <p>Michael Shannon, perhaps best known for his roles in Boardwalk Empire and Man of Steel, made an appearance in Groundhog Day early in his career as a newlywed 
For years after, Shannon may have been best known as that WrestleMania guy from Groundhog Day. There was theater and TV work in the 90s,  
Remember when Michael Shannon was in Groundhog Day? Hint: He loved Wrestlemania.  in 1993 he was just a dude who was stoked about Bill Murray buying him Wrestlemania tickets. I don’t like to  
One of Michael Shannon's first roles was in Groundhog Day with Bill Murray. WrestleMania! #groundhogday #michaelshannon #billmurray 
A note from Wild Card host Rachel Martin: Michael Shannon’s first role in a big movie was as a young newlywed in Groundhog Day.It’s a small part, and his big moment comes when Bill Murray’s character hands him a couple tickets to the local Wrestlemania event, and Shannon goes berserk with glee.

Groundhog Day (1993) - Factual errors - (at around 1h 29 mins) When Phil gives Debbie and Fred the Wrestlemania tickets as a wedding gift, Debbie reacts by saying "How did you know? We're going to be in Pittsburgh anyway!" Wrestlemania has never taken place in Pittsburgh. 
Michael Shannon has always been a weapon—although, for a long time, he was mostly one of the secret variety. After three years acting on the Chicago stage, the Kentucky-born Shannon’s entrée into moviedom was the small but memorable turn as the guy who gushes over the WrestleMania tickets he’s been gifted in Harold Ramis’s Groundhog Day (1993). 
Groundhog Day (1993) - (at around 1h 29 mins) When Phil surprises Fred and Debbie with tickets to Wrestlemania towards the end of the film, Fred responds with, "We were going up to Pittsburgh, anyways" There wasn't a Wrestlemania in Philadelphia until 1999. 
So, in the film Groundhog Day, Bill Murray gives Michael Shannon WM tickets Assuming the movie takes place the year it came out (1993), that means Michael Shannon went to WrestleMania IX. Yikes. 
Groundhog Day is a 1993 fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin, and starring Bill Murray.Known for massively popularizing the time loop trope (to the extent that it's referred to on this site as the "Groundhog Day" Loop), cementing its namesake day into the modern lexicon as a stand-in for an unpleasant, repetitive situation, and serving as a  
Pop Culture Holiday: TV stations typically celebrate the film on February 2nd along with the real Groundhog Day. To keep the reference, some stations will run a marathon of nothing but the movie over and over until the day passes. Retroactive Recognition: The assistant weatherman who's taking Phil's slot for the 10 o'clock show? It's Mozzie  
I love Groundhog Day (1993) and I've seen it over a hundred times since it came out. However, I still can't get over finding out that Fred, the young groom -to-be to whom Phil bestows Wrestlemania tickets was played by a 21 yo, then unknown but now legendary actor, Michael Shannon, who would later play General Zod, Elvis, the Iceman, and many more. 
Groundhog Day, Punxsutawney hold special meanings to WWE NXT double champ Adam Cole By Jim Varsallone. Updated June 02, 2018 9:17 AM.  They’re going to WrestleMania. 
We’ve got 20 facts about Groundhog Day you might not know, babe.  Fred, one of the two young newlyweds in the movie (who happily receive WrestleMania tickets), is played by none other than  
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
Ramis and Murray achieve a harmony of wit and wisdom that works so effortlessly on you, on us all, the phrase “Groundhog Day” in American vernacular has become a synonym for déjà vu. Re-living the same day ad nauseam, Phil’s amassed knowledge serves his interests—at first mundane, then selfish, then prurient. When he runs out of  
Groundhog Day (1993) clip with quote WrestleMania! No way! Yarn is the best search for video clips by quote. Find the exact moment in a TV show, movie, or music video you want to share. 
Phil, while he has lived the same day, still did different things from day to day. Lastly, Phil can't just 'commit a crime' metaphorically speaking to get himself re-sealed in a time bubble. Since he ultimately has no choice but to get to grips with no longer being in the time bubble, presumably he eventually just knuckles down and gets used to it. 
When we hear about Murray going to game 6 of the 2016 World Series in Cleveland with an extra ticket and ushering a surprised woman in a Cubs jersey with no ticket into the stadium and the seat next to his behind home plate, we may be reminded of Final Form Phil Connors, on the last, near-perfect iteration of Groundhog Day, surprising newlywed wrestling fans Debbie and Fred with tickets to  </p>
