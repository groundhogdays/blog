        <p>Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly.

One Writer Finally Deciphers The Groundhog Day Timeline. On February 2, 2011, former editor and COO of WhatCulture, Simon Gallagher, wrote a more in-depth article analyzing Groundhog Day’s events and pieced together his own timeline. 
For Connors, Groundhog Day begins each morning at 6:00 A.M., when he wakes up in his room in a Victorian bed and breakfast. His clock radio is always playing the same song, "I Got You Babe" by Sonny &amp; Cher. His memories of the "previous" day are intact, but he is trapped in a seemingly endless time loop, repeating the same day in the same small  
The most false, when it comes to Groundhog Day, is the widely-reported notion that an early version of Rubin's script had Phil explicitly saying to Rita that he had been "waiting for you every day  
In case you weren’t already feeling old, February 2 is the 30th anniversary of the release of Groundhog Day, the story of our favorite narcissistic, self-centered weatherman, who finds himself stuck in a time loop on Groundhog Day. This is particularly meaningful to me because I worked on this classic film and it just keeps reappearing every  
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis and written by Ramis and Danny Rubin. It stars Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliott. Murray portrays Phil Connors, a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2nd repeatedly. It was  
We see him relive Groundhog Day 38 times in the movie while another 414 days were mentioned in the film. Whatculture.com then used the theory that it takes 10,000 hours to master any one subject  
Groundhog Day: Directed by Harold Ramis. With Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliott, Stephen Tobolowsky. A narcissistic, self-centered weatherman finds himself in a time loop on Groundhog Day.

This may be the source of the idea that Phil was stuck in Groundhog Day for 10,000 years. Movie commentary by the director. These quotes are from the Special 15th Anniversary Edition DVD of Groundhog Day, in the audio commentary by the director, Harold Ramis. 7:58 into the movie, in reference to the writer, Danny Rubin: He's something of a Zen

Phil (Bill Murray)’s Timeline and Summary. Back; More ; Phil starts the movie by giving a rundown of the weather on a local Pittsburgh TV station. 
1993: Release of "Groundhog Day" Movie The release of the comedy film "Groundhog Day" in 1993 boosted the holiday's popularity, particularly on an international level. 1995: Early Spring Prediction 
Groundhog Day celebrations went from seeing about 5,000 spectators every year to somewhere around 35,000. “I would say it was the catalyst that put Punxsutawney Phil from having 5,000 people come for Groundhog Day to having 35,000 people come for Groundhog Day.

In case you didn't know, February 2nd is Groundhog Day. And to celebrate the momentous American holiday that inspired the bloody brilliant Bill Murray film of the same name, as well as the movie
