        <p>Groundhog Day (1993) - Awards, nominations, and wins.  Oscars Black History Month Sundance Film Festival SXSW  What is the streaming release date of Groundhog  
Groundhog Day is a 1993 American fantasy comedy film directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay by him and Danny Rubin.Starring Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, and Chris Elliott, it tells the story of a cynical television weatherman covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, who becomes trapped in a time loop, forcing him to relive February 2 repeatedly. 
His roles with Harold Ramis include Caddyshack (1980), Stripes (1981), Ghostbusters (1984), Ghostbusters II (1989), and Groundhog Day (1993). For his collaboration with Sofia Coppola in Lost in Translation (2003) he received a British Academy Film Award and a Golden Globe Award, and nominations for an Academy Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award.

“Groundhog Day” (1993) Like a metaphysical Frank Capra, Harold Ramis’ masterpiece  Powell &amp; Pressburger had mixed success with awards: Powell never won an Oscar,  
Groundhog Day (1993) Like many of the other movies on this list, Groundhog Day has certainly grown in acclaim in the years since its release. At the very least, people in 1993 didn’t widely  
Except that the day repeats itself, with infinitely minute variations, until Phil gets it right. In a minor scandal, the film got no nominations. An Oscar should have gone to Harold Ramis and Danny Rubin for the script, which deftly balances comedy and philosophy (is God a groundhog? Discuss), and another to Bill Murray for acting.

Groundhog Day was rated PG, allowing children access with parental permission. The film was seen as a potential sleeper success. [61] [62] Groundhog Day was one of many family films released that year, including Free Willy, Last Action Hero, and the highly anticipated Jurassic Park, which would go on to become the highest-grossing film to date  
Groundhog Day: Directed by Harold Ramis. With Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliott, Stephen Tobolowsky. A narcissistic, self-centered weatherman finds himself in a time loop on Groundhog Day. 
Hip Hop won big at the 93rd Academy Awards on Sunday (April 25) as Diddy and Joey Bada$$’sTwo Distant Strangers collected the Oscar for Best Live Action Short Film. 
The director is counting on the audience already being familiar with Groundhog Day, which is why it references title and the Sunny &amp; Cher song. It is not trying to steal the target audience of Groundhog Day so that Groundhog Day is less successful. It took the iconic premise of Groundhog Day and made its own unique story. 
Yes, Groundhog Day the musical won several awards. It was a smash success when it transferred from London to the Broadway stage in 2017. It was nominated for 7 Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Book of a Musical, and ended up winning the Tony for Best Musical Score for Tim Minchin.

I love Groundhog Day (1993) and I've seen it over a hundred times since it came out. However, I still can't get over finding out that Fred, the young groom -to-be to whom Phil bestows Wrestlemania tickets was played by a 21 yo, then unknown but now legendary actor, Michael Shannon, who would later play General Zod, Elvis, the Iceman, and many more. 
I turned my head and saw before me a face so brimming with warmth and gaiety that it would’ve melted the heart of the most venomous cynic. Resembling the whimsical hybrid of a rabbi and a teddy bear, Ramis happily indulged in several minutes of small talk with me, as I maintained a cool head, having had a few previous experiences rubbing shoulders with famous faces in the Windy City. 
GROUNDHOG DAY almost starred Tom Hanks instead of Bill Murray and here’s why the Oscar-winner turned it down. By George Simpson , Senior Film and Arts Reporter 14:30, Fri, Feb 2, 2018 | UPDATED  
Scorsese arguably should have won the Oscar for best director, but the fact that he wasn't even nominated is a bit of a joke. The film did win the Palme d'Or at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival, and is cited by the American Film Institute as the 52nd greatest American film ever made. 
As he awakens the next day, he finds it is not the next day at all, and that he is actually re-living February 2nd, or Groundhog Day, all over again. </p>
